\title{Errata to Apex LT Fall 2016}

\maketitle

The following errors exist in the Fall 2016 printed version of Apex LT:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes, ``In Exercises \#--\#'' in exercise directions will go too far, and refer to exercises past the end of the intended range.  This was an artifact of the way exercises were loaded.
\item p.\ 7, \S1.0 Exercises 11--14: The directions should be ``Graph the given $f$.''
\item p.\ 35, \S1.3 Example 1.3.7: The example should be: Evaluate $\ds\lim_{x\to 2}\dfrac{\sqrt{x+4}-2}x$.
\ifinstructor
\item p.\ 39, \S1.3\#33: The answer should be $1/6$.
\item p.\ 47, \S1.4\#13: The answer to parts b and d should be 0.
\fi
\item p.\ 47, \S1.4\#23: $\ds\lim_{-2^+}f(x)=0$ should be $\ds\lim_{x\to-2^+}f(x)=0$.
\item p.\ 60, \S1.5\#31: This problem ``Reviews'' the next section, and should be there instead.
\item p.\ 62, \S1.6 Example 1.6.2: The floor function returns the largest integer smaller than \emph{or equal to} the input.
\ifinstructor
\item p.\ 72, \S1.6\#41: The given answer of $a=1$, $b=-1$ is not continuous at $x=-1$.  The correct answer is $a=\frac34$, $b=-\frac14$.
\fi
\item p.\ 76, \S2.0 Example 2.0.3: Part 2 should begin $(x^{-3})^4$.  Part 3 should begin $(x^{-1/2})^{2/3}$.
\item p.\ 77, \S2.0 Example 2.0.5: The problem in part 1 should be $x^{7/3}-4x^{2/3}$.
\item p.\ 141, \S2.6 Example 2.6.4: On page 141, line 4, $2y^2$ should be $2x\cdot y^2$; line 5, $y^2$ should be $xy^2$.
\item pp.\ 304--306: The text states that moving a curve through space creates a solid, when it fact it creates a surface.  To create a solid, we need to move a region through space, or look at the region enclosed by a surface.  This leads to the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item p.\ 304, paragraph 2, line 2: ``a horizontal axis creates a three-dimensional solid'' should be ``a horizontal axis encloses a three-dimensional solid''.
\item p.\ 304, Key Idea 12: ``Let a solid be formed by revolving the curve'' should be ``Let a solid be enclosed by revolving the curve''.
\item p.\ 305, Example 6.2.2: The region being rotated is the one bounded by the curve $y=1/x$, $x=1$, $x=2$, and the $x$-axis.
\item p.\ 306, Example 6.2.3: The region being rotated is the one bounded by the curve $y=1/x$, $y=1$, $y=0.5$, and the $y$-axis.
\item p.\ 306: The paragraph following Example 6.2.3 states:
\begin{quote}
The previous two examples demonstrate how taking the same region and rotating it about two different axes will result in different solids and thus volumes.
\end{quote}
The examples do not have the same region.  This sentence should be deleted.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
