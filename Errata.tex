\maketitle

The following errors exist in the \term\ printed version of Apex LT:
\begin{itemize}
\item Examples are numbered within each section.  But when we refer to an example in a different section, it doesn't indicate that you should go to that section.  For example, in Section 6.3, ``Example 7'' should be ``Example 6.2.7''.
\item The prerequisite sections (1.0, 2.0, and 10.0) have the running header from the previous section.
\item Theorem 5 (Squeeze Theorem) requires the functions be defined and the squeezing to hold at the limit, which is unnecessary.
\item Example 1.3.7 should be $\ds \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x+4}-2}{x}$.
\item Definition 2 (One Sided Limits) and Definition 8 (Left and Right Continuity) requires that the function be defined in an open interval around the point, whereas it only needs to be defined to the left or right.
\item Definition 9 (Continuity on Closed Intervals) has ``left'' and ``right'' reversed.
\item Example 3.1.6: ``are are $0$ and $\pm\pi$'' should be ``are $0$ and $\pm\sqrt\pi$''.
\item The solution to \S7.3\#7 should be $\dfrac{1-x\ln x\ln5}{x5^x\ln5}$\smallskip
\item The solution to \S7.3\#21 should be $\dfrac{\ln\frac{245}3}{\ln3}=\dfrac{\ln245}{\ln3}-1$.
\item The solution to \S8.5\#1 should be $x\sin^{-1}x+\sqrt{1-x^2}+C$.  The given solution is $\ds\int x\sin^{-1}x dx$.\vspace{-.3\baselineskip}
\item The solution to \S8.5\#5 should be $\dfrac x{25\sqrt{x^2+25}}+C$.\vspace{-.5\baselineskip}
\item \S9.2 Theorem 64.  Part 1 assumes $r\neq1$.  The statement of part 2 assumes $S_n=\ds\sum_{k=0}^n ar^k$.\vspace{-\baselineskip} The proof assumes that $S_n=\ds\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k$ has $n$ terms.
\item \S9.2\#27--29: The index of summation should be $n$, not $i$.
\item \S9.3\#15 should be $\ds\sum_{i=3}^\infty\frac1{n\ln n[\ln(\ln n)]^p}$.
\item \S9.7\#13 should be $\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1-\cos n}{n^3}$.
\item \S9.8\#33: The desired answer is not a power series.
\item \S9.10\#15: Key Idea 32 gives the MacLaurin series for $\ln(x+1)$, and it converges on $(-1,1]$.  We can't expect students to prove convergence at the right endpoint at this time.
\item The Conic Sections portion is supposed to be labeled 10.0.  The initial title is unlabeled, and the exercises are labeled 10.-1.  (Additionally, the running header is incorrect, as previously noted.)
\item The solution to \S10.5\#9(a) should use $\theta$, not $t$. (b) should have $(x-\sqrt3/4)$, not $(x+\sqrt3/4)$.
\end{itemize}
