\maketitle

The following errors exist in the Fall 2016 printed version of Apex LT (but have been fixed in the electronic version):
\begin{itemize}
\item p.\ 47, \S1.4\#23: $\ds\lim_{-2^+}f(x)=0$ should be $\ds\lim_{x\to-2^+}f(x)=0$.
%\item p.\ 72, \S1.6\#41: The given answer of $a=1$, $b=-1$ is not continuous at $x=-1$.  The correct answer is $a=\frac34$, $b=-\frac14$.
\item pp.\ 304--306: The text states that moving a curve through space creates a solid, when it fact it creates a surface.  To create a solid, we need to move a region through space, or look at the region enclosed by a surface.  This leads to the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item p.\ 304, paragraph 2, line 2: ``a horizontal axis creates a three-dimensional solid'' should be ``a horizontal axis encloses a three-dimensional solid''.
\item p.\ 304, Key Idea 12: ``Let a solid be formed by revolving the curve'' should be ``Let a solid be enclosed by revolving the curve''.
\item p.\ 305, Example 6.2.2: The region being rotated is the one bounded by the curve $y=1/x$, $x=1$, $x=2$, and the $x$-axis.
\item p.\ 306, Example 6.2.3: The region being rotated is the one bounded by the curve $y=1/x$, $y=1$, $y=0.5$, and the $y$-axis.
\item p.\ 306: The paragraph following Example 6.2.3 states:
\begin{quote}
The previous two examples demonstrate how taking the same region and rotating it about two different axes will result in different solids and thus volumes.
\end{quote}
The examples do not have the same region.  This sentence should be deleted.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
