What to do about Schoolcraft citations? Include in text
arrow vectors




TODO:

can number example correctly.  “Example ## in Section #”?

chap 7 & 8 title
make odd/even line up

move chapter intro to after .0 and before .1
1.4: add an absolute value example
1.5: an example involving square roots as x->infinity
1.5#31 move to 1.6
1.6: box the def of left cont and right cont
2.2#13 should P(0)=0 and P(1)<0?
2.2#17 could have either answer
Should 2.4#62-64 move to 2.2?
2.5#38-41: Normal lines
2.6: “Implicitly defined function” in exercises
3.1#15(6): all others can find f’ without computation

Include solutions to all problems in the .0 sections in the back of the book.

lxfigure: no line break before caption

(eventually) fix example numbering to not display chap.sec.

Fix draw example line

Transitions into and out of each section.

My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  media9 includemedia alt text line break. no includemedia
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  add my links to videos in Calc 3
  js to have collapsible chapters in the TOC
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible

  Remove starting with math.  To find, try:
    grep '\.  \$' text/*
    grep '\. \$' text/*
  Manual adjustments:
    \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
    \clearpage
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{printquestions}}{\columnbreak}{}
    \drawexampleline
  Watch out for extra !
  Remove “cancel”
  replace all [vh]skip with [vh]space
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  use subsections where appropriate.  to find, try:
    grep noindent text/* | grep textbf
  unitfrac
  js to enable highlighting
  convert ref to autoref when possible. to find, try:
    grep '\\ref' text/* | grep -v 's \\ref' | grep -v '#\\ref' | grep -v refstepcounter
  remove restore box width
  remove draw example line
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break



Back of book:

Some calc 2 back of book questions that can wait:

There was Maclaurin series in addition to Taylor series.  I took it out.  Should I put it back in?

Are there other formulas that should go in?  I may put in the Left, Mid, and Right point formulas, if I can formulate the five so that they don’t take up as much space.
 no.

I’ve redone the table summarizing series tests.  I just want to make sure I’ve not left it less understandable.









Me:

7.4 calc 2:
p376: bad segue to next section.  put it in the next section?





Chapter 1:

Interactive demonstrations that we should find:
1.5 bisection method?

Chapter 2:

Interactive demonstrations that we should find:
2.1 secant line and tangent lines
2.1 overlay f and f’
2.3 overlay f, f’, and f”






Math typos:
7.4 p373 para3 L3: the displayed equation should have $[f’(c_i)]^2$.
8.3 p434 exercise 40 solution: diverges
8.7 p467 L1: In the displayed equation, $f^n$ should be $f^{(n)}$
same page, L-5: same thing
8.7 p471 para-2: In the displayed equation, $f^{(8)}$ should be $f^{(8)}(0)$

Typos:
6.7 p329 solution L1: “This _is_ equivalent to a special limit given”
8.1 p398 Example 230 solution 3: the pattern of signs opens a quotation that never closes
9.2 p506 between Examples 285 & 286: “chose” should be “choose”
9.4 p529 Example 301 solution para1 L2: “we often choose” should be “chose” (or “added” should be “add”)
9.4 p532 para2 L3: “a shape important _to_ the sensitivity of microphones”
9.5 p538 para3 L1: “We are interested in the lines tangent _to_ a given graph”
10.1 p558 para3 L3: “coeffiecients” should be “coefficients”
10.6 p615 para1 L4: The paragraph doesn’t end with a period.
12.4 p711 para2 L3: “enounter” should be “encounter” (which it is in the next paragraph, don’t let that mislead you)
12.7 p730 para3 L1: “In Figures 12.20” should be “Figure”
