5.2 p207: should y be v in figures?

Ally complains that "This HTML file contains an invalid heading structure"
(image?) directories in Windows use a separator \ which becomes %5C in html, and breaks

add hierarchy of function growths to LH section?


Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

html could do:
Pretext(MBX) conversion?
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  5.2: use something other than $\Delta x$ to represent a partition
  check units in center of mass calculations
  \exerciseset -> \begin{exerciseset} 423 times
  \example -> \begin{example} 596 times
  also theorems, definitions, and key ideas 363 times
  \ d, \,d, d become \dd
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and figure???
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck:
	cat text/*tex | aspell list -t --ignore=3 --ignore-case --add-texinfo-ignore=youtubeVideo | sort | uniq > misspell.txt
  reflection properties of conics?
  polar equation for conics?
  parabola as the limiting case of hyperbola, ellipse?
  ifthen -> etoolbox ?
  use subfig
  flexible vertical page length??

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?

Typos:

1.4p32 Th1.4.1: This needs to include "except possibly at $c$".
3.3p143 KI3.3.1: Since 1. allows for f' to be undefined, we should just have f be a continuous function, not necessarily a differentiable one.
5.4p236 T5.4.1: In order to be used by T5.4.4, you also need to conclude that $F$ is continuous at the endpoints.
6.7p340#42: 1^+ should be 1^-
13.7p837#10: Cylindrical should  be spherical.
13.7p837#15 solution: $z=1$ should be $z=0$.
13.7p838#17-22: The differentials should be in the order $d\rho d\phi d\theta$.
14.2p855 line -5: *Will* all the loops of different directions in the field,
14.3p861 Example 14.3.1 solution line 5: We should have $\vec r'_1(t)=\bracket{1,1}$, not $\bracket{1,2}$.
14.3p869#17-20: The solutions use (a)-(d); the problem directions use 1.-4.
14.4p879#19: The given curve is not closed. Using $\vec r(t)=\bracket{3t^2-2t-t^3,2(t-1)^2}$ gives the book's solution.
14.5p890#9: For $x=1$, the $x$-component to $\vec r$ should be 1.
14.5p890#13: The vertical surface is x^2+y^2/9=1 (3 times).
14.5p890#17: $2\le v\le3$ should be $2\le y\le3$.
14.5p890#23 solution: $\int_{-1}^1\int_0^{1-v^2}\sqrt{27}\ du\ dv=4\sqrt3\approx6.928$
14.6p899#5: The mass function should be $\delta=z+10$ in order to stay positive and give the book's answer.
