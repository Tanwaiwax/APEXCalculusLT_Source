Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?
11.5#31b typo
12.2#13: not a vector?
13.6#25-28: u=v/|v|?
13.9#5&15: switch?
14.1#17-22: compute?
14.3#15: one more step to find int exp(-x^2)?
14.4, 14.6: M_x=\int y\delta ? ask a physicist?

14.5#17,18 typo “you result”

note that some texts use |v| for ||v||

html could do:

ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
asymptote fonts?

11.2 KI51#3: Make theta,phi match spherical coordinates

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
13.3 see #27-30: f_x=… f_y=… => f= ?
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units)
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break
