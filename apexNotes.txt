TODO:

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
Paul Dawkins & Michael Corral now contributing authors.  Should we?
instructor solutions to all problems


I
2.4#62-64 should move to 2.2, or be labeled review
3.3: p163 between Thm 26 & KI 5: Need Darboux’s Theorem, not IVT, b/c f’ not necs. continuous
4.3: absolute and relative error? also in exercises?
4.4: add Fast Inverse Square Root question
5.2#13: Use an unknown function to avoid FTC?


II
chap 7 intro
7.3: another logarithmic differentiation example?


III
keep an eye out for !, especially when in a math context
Riemann sums are from 1 to n, with the endpoints x_0 and x_n, so that the i-th interval is [x_{i-1},x_i]
remove approximations when exact answers exist
don’t worry about margin figures that are too high/low/wrong side
School craft sections: curvilinear coordinates, Jacobian, Lagrange multipliers, last chapter.  Watch for inconsistencies:
	look for vectors that are bold
	look for vectors that are arrows (good), but there’s a missing space before the next thing (bad)
	change P(x,y,z) to (x,y,z)?


My to do:
  Fix draw example line
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  media9 includemedia alt text line break. no includemedia
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  add my links to videos in Calc 3
  js to have collapsible chapters in the TOC?
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible

  Manual adjustments:
    \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
    \clearpage
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{printquestions}}{\columnbreak}{}
    \drawexampleline
  Watch out for extra !
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  unitfrac
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break



Interactive demonstrations that we should find:
1.5 bisection method?
2.1 secant line and tangent lines
2.1 overlay f and f’
2.3 overlay f, f’, and f”



Math typos:
2.7 p119 para-2 L1 “In Figure 2.33 we see”: $f^{-1}$ should have $(x)$.
3.3 p137 between Thm29 & KI3: The IVT only applies if f’ is continuous.  Instead, we need Darboux’s Theorem (I had to look it up), which says that f’ satisfies the conclusion of the IVT, even if it’s not continuous.
5.4 p239 #54 solution: Should have a negative.
6.7 p329 Example 192 Solution 1 L1: I don’t see how Theorem 3 relates.  Do you mean Theorem 5, part 3?
7.4 p373 para3 L3: the displayed equation should have $[f’(c_i)]^2$.
8.1 p401 Figure 8.2(a): a_n should be a function of n, not x.
8.3 p434 exercise 40 solution: diverges
8.7 p467 L1: In the displayed equation, $f^n$ should be $f^{(n)}$
same page, L-5: same thing
8.7 p471 para-2: In the displayed equation, $f^{(8)}$ should be $f^{(8)}(0)$
9.4 p529 Example 301 solution para2 L1: P(0,2) should be P(2,0)
9.5 p539 L-1: The -1 should be -2.  The subsequent quadratic formula correctly uses -2.
9.5 p540: In the decimal approximations associated with $\theta = \sin^{-1} (\frac{-1+\sqrt {33}}{8})$, $0.6399$ should be $0.6349$ (this occurs twice) and $3.7815$ should be $2.5067$.
9.5 p544 Example 309 solution: The 1/2 disappears two steps from the end.
11.3 p647 mnote: The units of acceleration are ft/s^2 and m/s^2.
12.4 # 14 solution: There’s a $\v$ that should just be $v$.

I’ve noticed that you sometimes have a habit of starting your examples:
\example{label}{Title}{
Problem statement. . .}
This causes there to be a space before the problem statement.  Which is really only noticeable once you’re looking for it.

Typos:
1.5 p48 para-2 L1: “one can come up _with_ 0/0”.
1.6 p49 para1 L4: You refer to l’Hospital’s rule.  Everywhere else, you spell it l’H\^opital
2.7 p120 Figure 2.31, Theorem 23: These look to be the only places where you put the argument to arc trig functions in parentheses.  Usually, you have $\sin^{-1}x$ instead of $\sin^{-1}(x)$.
4.4 p187 Exercise 38: “Exercises 36” should be singular.
6.1 p267 Theorem 46: “Trigonomentric” is misspelled.
6.7 p329 solution L1: “This _is_ equivalent to a special limit given”
7.2 p358 Figure 7.16: The label (b) is next to the bottom picture, not between the last two.
7.4 p369 para-2 L3: “segment as the-y- hypotenuse”
8.1 p398 Example 230 solution 3: the pattern of signs opens a quotation that never closes
9.2 p506 between Examples 285 & 286: “chose” should be “choose”
9.4 p529 Example 301 solution para1 L2: “we often choose” should be “chose” (or “added” should be “add”)
9.4 p532 para2 L3: “a shape important _to_ the sensitivity of microphones”
9.5 p538 para3 L1: “We are interested in the lines tangent _to_ a given graph”
9.4 & 9.5: “cardiod” should be “cardioid” (2 times in 9.4, 4 times in 9.5, 3 times in 9.5’s exercises)
9.5: “cardiord” should be “cardioid”
9.5 p541 “Area” para1 L2: “horzontal” should be “horizontal”
10.1 p558 para3 L3: “coeffiecients” should be “coefficients”
10.6 p615 para1 L4: The paragraph doesn’t end with a period.
12.4 p711 para2 L3: “enounter” should be “encounter” (which it is in the next paragraph; don’t let that mislead you)
12.7 p730 para3 L1: “In Figures 12.20” should be singular
Back of book, p-6, Integration Rules #5: $n\neq -1$ is in there twice.
