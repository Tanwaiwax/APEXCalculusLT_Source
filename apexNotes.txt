Collings A11.1#37: adjust image for clarity

Collings 13.8:
For $f:R\to R$, $a$ such that $f’(a)=0$, $g:R^2\to R$, and $b$ such that $g’(b)=0$.

Apex: critical point: $(a,f(a))$ (p146), and $b$ (p837)

critical point: $a$, $b$:
Rogawski; Wikipedia; Thomas, Weir, & Haas; Briggs & Cochran

critical number: $a$, critical point: $b$:
Stewart; Sullivan & Miranda

Ayers: critical value: $a$, critical point: $(a,f(a))$


Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

9.4 Check page break at Limit Comparison Test
13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

add something on multi-v Taylor series? or just 2 variable version?
add 2 variable version from revisions/taylor to 13.7 prior to The Gradient and Normal Lines, Tangent Planes (or 13.4 prior to Error/Sensitivity Analysis?).  add 3 variable if requested




html could do:
MBX conversion

ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
asymptote fonts?

	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone?

Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration

Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  complete rearrangement of text/ ?
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck - aspell

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?
