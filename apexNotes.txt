Apex questions:

We currently use a little more than two pages to prove the FTC.  I think we could cut that in half by appealing to the definition of the limit (see attached).  Should we?

While looking at the previous, I realized that we never prove that |∫f| ≤ ∫|f|.  We could have that fact as early as 5.2, but it would possibly fit best with Theorem 5.3.3 "Further Properties of Definite Integrals".  It could also be an exercise or an example.  Do we want to have it somewhere?

10.3 "Calculus and Parametric Equations" talks about arc length, but we don't mention speed until 12.3.  Should we have something talking about speed in 10.3?  Stewart doesn't. Rogawski introduces speed as the derivative of arc length.

check 3d images 6.3.6, 6.3.7
get x.0 into pdf TOC sidebar
.9.8#32 not an actual power series
.10.1#11 spacing is odd
.10.3 should it have speed?

prc html page please: need .prc
website pretty please: need [A-Z.]








Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.



html could do:
MBX conversion
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.

Typos:

1.1 p6 Line 3: $\sin(x)/x$ should be $\sin(1/x)$.
1.5#19: x>0 should be x\ne0
3.1 Theorem 3.1.1: $I$ should be a *finite* closed interval.
3.4#3,4 p157: "Is is" should be "Is it" (twice).
Example 3.5.2 Solution item 2: $(x^2+x-6)^2$ should be $(x^2-x-6)^2$.
4.1#2: Newtons’ should be Newton’s.
7.5 p387 para 2: Three occurrences of “Newton” should be “newton”.
7.5#1: Newton-meter should be newton-meter.
7.5#27: “an truncated” should be “a truncated”.
8.4 Example 8.4.3#2: The summation should begin at 2.
9.4 #5 The solution should specify the comparison ``for all $n\ge 3$''.
8.4 # 23, 24, 31, 33: ditto
8.8 Example 8.8.4, line -2: When -1<k<0, the interval of convergence is (-1,1].  (Indeed, (1+x)^k isn't defined when x=-1 and k<0.)
9.5 Example 9.5.7: The parameter starts as t, but then switches to theta.
12.8 Example 12.8.7 p757 line 5: these are simultaneously 0 only when $w=0$, with consequent changes in plurality in the next sentence.
12.8 Example 12.8.7 p757 para4: This gives a volume of approximately 20,347.
14 p840 line 9: "the one is well" should be "then one is well".
14.3 p865 line 5: ``A region is simply connected\ldots'' should be ``A connected region is simply connected\ldots''.
