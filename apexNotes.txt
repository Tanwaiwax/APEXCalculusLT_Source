Package needspace?

Pass some options to make index to get alphabetical headings?  See if that carries through to LaTeXML

Cover figure?
I: Fig 5.3.6 R_{16} for 4x-x^2 over [0,4] (F2.1.2? 2.1.3?)
II: F8.7.5 T_5 for e^{-x^2} over [0,1] (F9.9.2? Gallery image?)
III: F15.4.8 ?


8.4#39 move to 8.3 (needs a bit more space)
9.8 p529: all series tests require positivity?
D11.4.1: Maybe give the box method for computing?
12.5 better arc length parameterization? Frenet frame?
F14.2.8: use axis equal image
C15: should 2d curl match 3d curl?
15.4: Green's Theorem on region with holes



LaTeXML:
Some Patrick JMT is forcing viewing on YouTube.  Drop for something else?
1.3 math input error
F2.5.2 head space
F5.3.4
Ex9.6.1
11.1.15ff side by side


4.2 check that colors work in b&w ?
13.2 T3 break p2 ? It's a tabular
15.1 F6 color


To make LaTeXML on Talon:
: module load apptainer
: cd
: export LATEXML_KPSEWHICH=$HOME/.tex/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/kpsewhich
: singularity shell --bind /usr/bin:/home/timothy.prescott/obin latexml/latexml.sif 
: ./perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew switch perl-5.34.0
: cd git/LaTeXML
: perl Makefile.PL
: /home/timothy.prescott/obin/make
: /home/timothy.prescott/obin/make test




Ally complains that "This HTML file contains an invalid heading structure"

Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

html could do:
Pretext(MBX) conversion?
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/ ?
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
actual 3d via phone

https://web.hypothes.is/ Hypothesis social annotation tool for textbook ?

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?

possible examples or exercises:
1.4 chemical rate of reaction: 3(coth(x)-1/x)/x; harmonic mean near 0, inf; electron: 2((1-z^2)^{-.5}-1)/z^2 (see Dropbox/research/MAA/teaching/limit examples.pdf)
4.2 swim across circular pool?
9.3 Riemann Zeta function??
swing jump distance:
 starting from horizontal, with t angle from vertical and origin on ground:
 conservation of energy => v^2=2gL cos t
 L<sin t,1-cos t>+v<cos t,sin t>-<0,gt^2/2>
 - leads to a fairly nasty expression to solve
12.5 Frenet Frame?



Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  ragged bottom?
  pdfsizeopt to python 3? or just get it working again?
  tocbibind ?
  check units in center of mass calculations
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and exercise and figure???
  use subfig

  | to norm/abs
  Mathtools?
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  use SI units more?
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?
