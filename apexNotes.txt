Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck - aspell

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

10.1#19: The solution is $x^2+z^2=\frac1{(1+y^2)^2}$.
10.3 p586 Definition 59: Should specify $v\ne0$.
10.5#31b “allows one to the use the formula.”
11.2 p637 Theorem 94: $\int\vec r$ isn’t defined.  We could take this to be a definition instead of a theorem.  The alternative would be to define $\int\vec r$ as the inverse operation of $\vec r’$, but I’m having trouble seeing how that would extend to definite integrals.
11.2#13: The function is not a vector (on the other hand, one could argue part of the problem is that realization).
12.4 Definition 88 p710: The dz on the left should be dw.
12.6#25-28(b): Should probably specify that $\vec u$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\vec v$.
12.8#17: The solution should have $f(x)=\dots\pm2\sqrt{4-x^2}$ instead of $f(x)=\dots\pm\sqrt{4-x^2}$ (three locations).  The absolute maximum is at $(\sqrt2,\sqrt2,4+4\sqrt2)$ (I forget if I’ve told you that one).
13.5#17,18: “compare you result with the known formula.”
