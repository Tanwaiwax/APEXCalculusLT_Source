1&2:
9.5#5-20: four problems need the ratio test

3:
read through 14

both:

Change numbering to match examples?

Collings 13.8:
For $f:R\to R$, $a$ such that $f’(a)=0$, $g:R^2\to R$, and $b$ such that $g’(b)=0$.

Apex: critical point: $(a,f(a))$ (p146), and $b$ (p837)

critical point: $a$, $b$:
Rogawski; Wikipedia; Thomas, Weir, & Haas; Briggs & Cochran

critical number: $a$, critical point: $b$:
Stewart; Sullivan & Miranda

Ayers: critical value: $a$, critical point: $(a,f(a))$


Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

9.4 Check page break at Limit Comparison Test
13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

add something on multi-v Taylor series? or just 2 variable version?
add 2 variable version from revisions/taylor to 13.7 prior to The Gradient and Normal Lines, Tangent Planes (or 13.4 prior to Error/Sensitivity Analysis?).  add 3 variable if requested

Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  complete rearrangement of text/ ?
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck - aspell

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

p284 6.2#26 solution: The second term $x\left(\ln\abs{x+1}\right)$ should be $x\left(\ln\abs{x+1}\right)^2$.
pA.10 6.4#23 solution: $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}2\right)$ should be $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}3\right)$.
pA.11 6.8#3 Solution: Should have $\le10$ instead of $<10$.
p409 8.1#13-16: $a_n$ is multiply defined
p424 8.3#40 solution: Diverges by a Limit Comparison Test with $1/sqrt n$.
pA.14 8.3#41a solution: $a_n/n<n$ should be $a_n/n<a_n$
pA.14 8.4#21 solution: $e^2$ should be $e^{-2}$.
8.6#9-24: Several solutions have $x=$ an interval.
p475 8.7#33: Should specify that it is centered at $c=1$ (and the solution should have $(-1)^{n+1}$ in place of $(-1)^n$).  And 29-33 might want to ask for the $x^n$ term, since Taylor polynomials start with the 0th term.
pA. 8.8#11 solution: The Taylor Series should be $\frac12+\sum_{n=1}^\infty$.
pA. 9.3#11 solution: a: The second term in the numerator should be doubled; b: The normal line is $y=-x$.
pA. 9.3#29 solution: The intervals should be: concave up: $(-\pi/2,0)$; concave down: $(0,\pi/2)$.
pA. 9.4#36 solution: $x^2y^2x^2$ should be $x^2y^2$.
pA. 9.4#48 solution: $P(-1/2,\pi/3)$ should be $P(-1/2,2\pi/3)$
