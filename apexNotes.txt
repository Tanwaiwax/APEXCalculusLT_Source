Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

add something on multi-v Taylor series? or just 2 variable version?
add 2 variable version from revisions/taylor to 13.7 prior to The Gradient and Normal Lines, Tangent Planes (or 13.4 prior to Error/Sensitivity Analysis?).  add 3 variable if requested




html could do:
MBX conversion
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  complete rearrangement of text/ ?
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck - aspell

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

p258(v4) Example 5.5.8, Figure 5.5.14: Since you measured every 30 seconds, the time column should be labeled “Measurement #”.  Or you can leave it as time, but change 7 to 3.5 min.
p284 6.2#26 solution: The second term $x\left(\ln\abs{x+1}\right)$ should be $x\left(\ln\abs{x+1}\right)^2$.
pA.10 6.4#23 solution: $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}2\right)$ should be $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}3\right)$.
pA.11 6.8#3 Solution: Should have $\le10$ instead of $<10$.
p409 8.1#13-16: $a_n$ is multiply defined
p424 8.3#40 solution: Diverges by a Limit Comparison Test with $1/sqrt n$.
pA.14 8.3#41a solution: $a_n/n<n$ should be $a_n/n<a_n$
pA.14 8.4#21 solution: $e^2$ should be $e^{-2}$.
8.6#9-24: Several solutions have $x=$ an interval.
p475 8.7#33: Should specify that it is centered at $c=1$ (and the solution should have $(-1)^{n+1}$ in place of $(-1)^n$).  And 29-33 might want to ask for the $x^n$ term, since Taylor polynomials start with the 0th term.
p829 13.7 Figure 13.7.2 caption: canonical is misspelled
pA. 8.8#11 solution: The Taylor Series should be $\frac12+\sum_{n=1}^\infty$.
pA. 9.3#11 solution: a: The second term in the numerator should be doubled; b: The normal line is $y=-x$.
pA. 9.3#29 solution: The intervals should be: concave up: $(-\pi/2,0)$; concave down: $(0,\pi/2)$.
pA. 9.4#36 solution: $x^2y^2x^2$ should be $x^2y^2$.
pA. 9.4#48 solution: $P(-1/2,\pi/3)$ should be $P(-1/2,2\pi/3)$
pA. 14.3#17c solution: -1t should be t-1
p 862 Example 14.3.2 solution line 1: parameterizing is misspelled
p 865 para 2 line -3: continuously is misspelled
p 875 Example 14.4.2 solution para 2 line 1: parameterizations is misspelled
p 884 Example 14.5.5 title: cylindrical is misspelled
The units Newtons and Joules should be capitalized
pA. 15.3#20d solution: 250 should be 0
