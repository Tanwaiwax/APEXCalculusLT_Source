 p 542: requirements for Taylor's theorem
 S9.10: when is a function equal to a power series

Ally complains that "This HTML file does not have a language set" and "This HTML file contains an invalid heading structure"

check 3d images 6.3.6, 6.3.7
get x.0 into pdf TOC sidebar
.9.8#32 not an actual power series
.10.1#11 spacing is odd
.10.3 should it have speed?

prc html page please: need .prc
website pretty please: need [A-Z.]








Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.



html could do:
MBX conversion
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.

  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and figure???

  ifthen -> etoolbox ?
  use subfig

  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:

  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

1.5#19: x>0 should be x\ne0
3.1 Theorem 3.1.1: $I$ should be a *finite* closed interval.
3.4#3,4 p157: "Is is" should be "Is it" (twice).
Example 3.5.2 Solution item 2: $(x^2+x-6)^2$ should be $(x^2-x-6)^2$.
4.1#2: Newtons’ should be Newton’s.
5.5 p251, line 7: the top corners of each trapezoid *lie* on the graph.
6.3 p298: "vise-versa" should be "vice versa".
6.8 p344 line 6: $\lim_{t\to0^-}\left(-\dfrac1t+1\right)$ should be $\lim_{t\to0^-}\left(-\dfrac1t-1\right)$.
6.8 p349 Figure 6.8.12: The graph labels should be switched.
7.5 p387 para 2: Three occurrences of “Newton” should be “newton”.
7.5#1: Newton-meter should be newton-meter.
7.5#27: “an truncated” should be “a truncated”.
8.2 p422 line 7: $\left(\dfrac12\right)^2$ should be $\left(\dfrac12\right)^n$.
8.2 p423 Definition 8.2.3: If a<0 and p is non-integral, then (an+b)^p may not be defined.  You could assume that it's a p-series only when it's always defined, but it may be easier to just assume that a>0 and an+b≠0.
8.4 Example 8.4.3#2: The summation should begin at 2.
8.5 p452 Theorem 8.5.2: "partial sums" should be "partial sum".
8.5 p452 Example 8.5.2: "sum" should be "sums"
8.5 p453 line -6: The final inequality with $L$ is in the wrong order.
8.7 p474 line -3: Maclaurin series should be Maclaurin polynomial.
8.7 Theorem 8.7.1: The proof needs I to be an open interval.  The maximum is then over all z between x and c, and requires that f^{(n+1)} be continuous.  Changing the interval for the maximum simplifies Examples 8.7.3#1,2 & 8.7.5#3 and Exercises 8.7#23-25.  8.7#26 has other problems.
8.7#21-24: The error bounds in the solution do not need \pm.
8.7#26: The nth derivative is not bounded in n.  Correct solution: The $n^\text{th}$ derivative of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ has a maximum on $[3,4]$ of $(2n-3)!!(-1)^{n+1}3^{1/2}6^{-n}$.  Thus $\abs{R_n(3)}\leq \frac{3^{1/2}2^{-2}}{3^n n(n+1)}$. When $n=5$, this is less than $0.0001$.
8.8 p488: Analyticity lets you go from a function to its power series.  To go the other direction, you need the converse theorem.  Something like: "If a function is equal to some power series on an interval, then that power series is the Taylor series of the function."  Eg, Example 8.8.5 gives a power series for e^x cos x, but we don't have a way to know that it is the Taylor series.
8.8 p494 line 8: "terms shown above *gives* the approximation"
9.4 #5 The solution should specify the comparison ``for all $n\ge 3$''.
8.4 # 23, 24, 31, 33: ditto
8.8 Example 8.8.4, line -2: When -1<k<0, the interval of convergence is (-1,1].  (Indeed, (1+x)^k isn't defined when x=-1 and k<0.)
9.4 p540 para 2, line 4: "It's rectangular" should be "Its rectangular".
9.4 p542 para 4, line 3: 2\textsuperscript{nd} quadrant should be 1\textsuperscript{st} quadrant.
9.5 Example 9.5.7: The parameter starts as t, but then switches to theta.
9.5 # 7b: In the solution, you may want to have $(2/\pi)$ and $(\pi/2)$ in parentheses.
12.8 Example 12.8.7 p757 line 5: these are simultaneously 0 only when $w=0$, with consequent changes in plurality in the next sentence.
12.8 Example 12.8.7 p757 para4: This gives a volume of approximately 20,347.
14 p840 line 9: "the one is well" should be "then one is well".
14.3 p865 line 5: ``A region is simply connected\ldots'' should be ``A connected region is simply connected\ldots''.
