Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration


Calculus I notes:

Calculus II notes:
7.2 Thm 48: I think this doesn’t need to be a theorem because of trig substitutions later.
7.2#7,13,26,28 (p. 352): These use ln or exp, which isn't introduced until 7.3 (but was introduced in chap 2).
7.4 I think this has too many Key Ideas.  Could we demote 21, 22, & 23?
10.0 Do we want the calculus of conic sections?  (reflection properties, what else? parabola the limiting case of an ellipse?)

Calculus III notes: (11-12: JS; 13-14.3: AB; 14.4-15: TP)

The book favors bracket notation for vectors over i,j,k.  In the exercises this favoritism is sometimes exclusive.  Do we want to switch some exercises to use i,j,k?

Do we want to remove degrees when they come after the equivalent radian measure?

12.1: Sections 10.2 & 10.3 are “(Calculus and) Parametric Equations”.  Some of this is very similar.

12.3 p739 Do we want Key Idea 57 (Projectile Motion) to no longer be a key idea?

12.4 p803 Example 3: This is a total differential question to estimate √x sin y.  Are we supposed to have a calculator or not?

15.6: How key are key ideas 65-67 (div grad curl Laplacian in various coordinate systems)?  Do we want people trying to memorize that?

Do we want a chapter 15 summary showing the various integrals and fundamental theorems and how they’re all related?



My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible?

  Watch out for extra !
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  unitfrac
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break



Math typo:
p190 5.1 Theorem 34 only holds on an interval.  Similarly, the paragraph after should end ``Using Definition 19, we can say that on an interval''.
p414 8.2 Theorem 60: part 1 is only true if $r\neq 1$.
p487 8.8 Exercise 15: Equality at x=2 requires Abel’s Theorem; equality on (0,1) requires the Cauchy form of the remainder.  (You currently have x^{n+1} move from a denominator to a numerator.
p487 8.8 Exercise 16: The problem asks for (-1,0).  The solution proves it for (0,1) with an incorrect equality.
p697 12.3 Example 407 Solution parts 1 & 2: In both, you have $f_{yx}=d/dx(f_x)$.
p815 13.6 para5: I believe “the gradient is orthogonal to $\vecr$ itself” should be “the gradient is orthogonal to the level curve” (which gets repeated in the next sentence anyway).
p743 13.8 Theorem 115: The conditions should be “$P$ is a critical point and all second order derivatives of $f$ are continuous at $P$” (and differentiability is obviously not enough).
pA19 9.5#9b: x=√3/4, so these should be (x-√3/4).  (And in (a), you want $\theta$, not $t$.)

Typo:
p147 3.4 “means finding the where” should be “means finding where”
p176 4.3 Example 104 L1: “an power station” should be “a power station”
p323 6.6#40: “multiply” is missing its first L.
p611 10.5 Example 348 The solution begins “The equation of the line line”
p661 11.4 Example 383 solution para-2 L-3: accelerating is spelled “acclerating”
p733 12.7 para-1 L-5: “it is _a_ general geometric concept”
p740 12.8 Definition 99 #3 L-1: “_an_ -a- absolute maximum”
p748 12.8 para3 L3 (1st displayed equation): V(wl) should be V(w,l)
p762 13.2 para-2 L1: “satisfying way of computing area” should be “volume”
