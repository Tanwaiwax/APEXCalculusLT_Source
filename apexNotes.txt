Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

html could do:
Pretext(MBX) conversion?
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
webgl html pages for 3d
actual 3d via phone



All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?

possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.3 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance:
 starting from horizontal, with t angle from vertical and origin on ground:
 conservation of energy => v^2=2gL cos t
 L<sin t,1-cos t>+v<cos t,sin t>-<0,gt^2/2>
 - leads to a fairly nasty expression to solve


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  ragged bottom?
  pdfsizeopt to python 3? or just get it working again?
  tocbibind?
  5.2: use something other than $\Delta x$ to represent a partition
  check units in center of mass calculations
  \ d, \,d, d become \dd
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and exercise and figure???
  use subfig

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  use SI units more?
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?
