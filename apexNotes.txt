TODO:

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
Paul Dawkins & Michael Corral now contributing authors.  Should we?


I
4.3: absolute and relative error? also in exercises?
4.4: add Fast Inverse Square Root question


II
chap 7 intro
7.3: another logarithmic differentiation example?


III
keep an eye out for !, especially when in a math context
Riemann sums are from 1 to n, with the endpoints x_0 and x_n, so that the i-th interval is [x_{i-1},x_i]
remove approximations when exact answers exist
don’t worry about margin figures that are too high/low/wrong side
School craft sections: curvilinear coordinates, Jacobian, Lagrange multipliers, last chapter.  Watch for inconsistencies:
	look for vectors that are bold
	look for vectors that are arrows (good), but there’s a missing space before the next thing (bad)
	change P(x,y,z) to (x,y,z)?


My to do:
  Fix draw example line
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  media9 includemedia alt text line break. no includemedia
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  add my links to videos in Calc 3
  js to have collapsible chapters in the TOC?
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible

  Manual adjustments:
    \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
    \clearpage
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{printquestions}}{\columnbreak}{}
    \drawexampleline
  Watch out for extra !
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  unitfrac
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break



Interactive demonstrations that we should find:
1.5 bisection method?
2.1 secant line and tangent lines
2.1 overlay f and f’
2.3 overlay f, f’, and f”
