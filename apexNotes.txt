Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

html could do:
Pretext(MBX) conversion?
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/ ?
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
actual 3d via phone

https://web.hypothes.is/ Hypothesis social annotation tool for textbook ?

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?

possible examples:
9.3 Riemann Zeta function??
swing jump distance:
 starting from horizontal, with t angle from vertical and origin on ground:
 conservation of energy => v^2=2gL cos t
 L<sin t,1-cos t>+v<cos t,sin t>-<0,gt^2/2>
 - leads to a fairly nasty expression to solve


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  ragged bottom?
  pdfsizeopt to python 3? or just get it working again?
  tocbibind ?
  check units in center of mass calculations
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and exercise and figure???
  use subfig

  | to norm/abs
  Mathtools?
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  use SI units more?
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?
