Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.

html could do:
Pretext(MBX) conversion?
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?

possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.3 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  find big|?
  pdfsizeopt to python 3?
  5.2: use something other than $\Delta x$ to represent a partition
  check units in center of mass calculations
  \exerciseset -> \begin{exerciseset} 423 times. interacted weirdly with enumerate
  \example -> \begin{example} 596 times
  \ d, \,d, d become \dd
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and figure???
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck:
	cat text/*tex | aspell list -t --ignore=3 --ignore-case --add-texinfo-ignore=youtubeVideo | sort | uniq > misspell.txt
  ifthen -> etoolbox ?
  use subfig
  flexible vertical page length??

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  use SI units more?
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?
