remove all !?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration


Calculus I notes:

Calculus II notes:
7.2 Thm 48: I think this doesn’t need to be a theorem because of trig substitutions later.
7.2#7,13,26,28 (p. 352): These use ln or exp, which isn't introduced until 7.3 (but was introduced in chap 2).
7.4 I think this has too many Key Ideas.  Could we demote 21, 22, & 23?
10.0 Do we want the calculus of conic sections?  (reflection properties, what else? parabola the limiting case of an ellipse?)

Calculus III notes: (11-12: JS; 13-14.3: AB; 14.4-15: TP)

The book favors bracket notation for vectors over i,j,k.  In the exercises this favoritism is sometimes exclusive.  Do we want to switch some exercises to use i,j,k?

Do we want to remove degrees when they come after the equivalent radian measure?

12.1: Sections 10.2 & 10.3 are “(Calculus and) Parametric Equations”.  Some of this is very similar.

12.3 p739 Do we want Key Idea 57 (Projectile Motion) to no longer be a key idea?

12.4 p803 Example 3: This is a total differential question to estimate √x sin y.  Are we supposed to have a calculator or not?

15.6: How key are key ideas 65-67 (div grad curl Laplacian in various coordinate systems)?  Do we want people trying to memorize that?

Do we want a chapter 15 summary showing the various integrals and fundamental theorems and how they’re all related?



My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible?

  Watch out for extra !
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units)
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break
