remove all !?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.

We need more difficult problems

My to do:
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible?

  $$, |, blue
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units)
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break
