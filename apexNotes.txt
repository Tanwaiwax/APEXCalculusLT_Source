Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.



html could do:
MBX conversion
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  change - - to -
  \exerciseset -> \begin{exerciseset}
  \example -> \begin{example} ?
  \ d, \,d, d become \dd
  complete rearrangement of text/ ?
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck - aspell
  ifthen -> etoolbox ?
  use subfig

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

exercise sets with an odd number of problems:
01_04_exset_03
02_06_exset_02
04_04_exset_03
05_01_exset_01, 05_01_exset_02
06_02_exset_03
06_03_exset_02
07_04_exset_04
08_07_exset_06
09_02_exset_09
10_04_exset_01
10_05_exset_05

also:
10.2#21 throws off the parity

02_01_exset_05: the enum counter resets, for some reason.
2.1#34 solution: g’=0 at x=0
2.3#26 doesn’t seem to belong to that instruction set, leaving the set with an odd number of problems
4.4#30 you probably want y instead of f(x)
p258 Example 5.5.8, Figure 5.5.14: Since you measured every 30 seconds, the time column should be labeled “Measurement #”.  Or you can leave it as time, but change 7 to 3.5 min.
pA.11 6.4#23 solution: $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}2\right)$ should be $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}3\right)$.
pA.12 6.8#3 Solution: Should have $\le10$ instead of $<10$.
p360 7.1#19,20: These don’t really belong to their exercise set
p417 8.1#13-16: $a_n$ is multiply defined
pA.15 8.3#41a solution: $a_n/n<n$ should be $a_n/n<a_n$
pA.15 8.4#21 solution: $e^2$ should be $e^{-2}$.
p483 8.7#29-34 might want to ask for the $x^n$ term, since Taylor polynomials start with the 0th term.
pA.17 8.8#11 solution: The Taylor Series should be $\frac12+\sum_{n=1}^\infty$.
pA.19 9.3#11 solution: a: The second term in the numerator should be doubled; b: The normal line is $y=-x$.
pA.19 9.3#29 solution: The intervals should be: concave up: $(-\pi/2,0)$; concave down: $(0,\pi/2)$.
p545 9.4#50 solution: $P(-1/2,\pi/3)$ should be $P(-1/2,2\pi/3)$
pA.34 14.3#17c solution: -1t should be t-1
p869 14.3#20d solution: 250 should be 0

Multiple places: The units Newtons and Joules should be capitalized

Grammar:

p292 6.2#4: original is misspelled.
p496 8.8#12 solution: an open quote is never closed
p557 9.5#34 solution: Pythagorean is misspelled
p793 Def&Thm 13.4.2: (x_2,y_2) should have a comma after it
p829 13.7 Figure 13.7.2 caption: canonical is misspelled
p862 Example 14.3.2 solution line 1: parameterizing and parameterization are misspelled
p865 para 2 line -3: continuously is misspelled
p875 Example 14.4.2 solution para 2 line 1: parameterizations is misspelled
p884 Example 14.5.5 title: cylindrical is misspelled
