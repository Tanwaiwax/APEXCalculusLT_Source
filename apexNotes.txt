Teaching 60%
Competently prepare 5 courses and teach 19 credit hours of regularly scheduled online courses, maintain reasonable office hours, and advise students as assigned. Tentative teaching assignment for next year (estimated enrollment): Fall: Math 105 (30 students), 165 (40 students) & 265 (40 students); Spring: Math 105 (30 students), Math 166 (40 students), & 266 (40 students).  Develop curriculum for Math Active Learning Lab [MALL/Emporium].


Research 30%
Maintain and update hardware and software for MALL.  Manage and analyze student data, reporting as necessary.  Interface between softwares for the lab.  Publish research in mathematics scholarship of teaching and learning as appropriate.  Continue revising open educational calculus textbook and converting to website.

Service 10%
Serve on A&S Student Technology Fee Committee; departmental Calculus and Precalculus Committee; and other committees as assigned or or elected.  Advise the UND Math Club.


















Whenever conflict of interest and President Trump have come up, Republicans have been quick to point out that the president is not subject to conflict of interest laws.
1. What’s the possibility of congress updating the current law to say that he is?
2. Why can’t the current law be applied to the president’s children?

All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
Paul Dawkins & Michael Corral now contributing authors.  Should we?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration



II notes:
7.2 Thm 48: doesn’t need to be a theorem b/c of trig subs?
7.2#7,13,26,28 (p. 352): Uses natural log or exp, which isn't introduced until 7.3 (but was introduced in chap 2).
7.2#33,34: These are reviews of 2.6. Do we want that?
7.3#17 (p. 361) requires advanced integration techniques
7.4: too many Key Ideas? cut 21, 22, 23?
7.4#30,31,35,36,38,39,43 (p. 372) requires advanced integration techniques
8 intro p381: “The next chapter” is chap 6.  Rephrase intro?
8.2.6 uses \int\sec x dx from 5.5.8.  Do we want to remind people of it?
9.3#3: move to 9.5 and rephrase?
9.4#12-24: _Direct_ Comparison Test?
9.10 Key Idea 32: ln(1+x) to ln(1-x)?  Use \prod to shorten (1+x)^k ?
9.10#15: ln(1+x) on (-1,1)?
9.10#16: show equality on (-1,1)?
9.10#29: non-zero terms?
10.0 Do we want the calculus of conic sections?  (reflection properties, what else?)
10.1#23-26: Do we care if f’ undefined?
10.2 Exercises 27-30 use calc? Should smoothness be in 10.3?


III
keep an eye out for !, especially when in a math context
Riemann sums are from 1 to n, with the endpoints x_0 and x_n, so that the i-th interval is [x_{i-1},x_i]
remove approximations when exact answers exist
School craft sections: curvilinear coordinates section, Jacobian section, Lagrange multipliers section, line & surface integrals chapter.  Watch for inconsistencies:
	look for vectors that are bold instead of arrows
	look for vectors that are arrows (good), but there’s a missing space before the next thing (bad)
	we want to change P(x,y,z) to (x,y,z)
	the unit vectors e somehow became capitalized. :(


My to do:
  Fix draw example line
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck
  media9 includemedia alt text line break. no includemedia
  convert figs.png back to tex
  convert figs.asy to javascript
  add my links to videos in Calc 3
  use xslt to remove need for js when possible?

  Manual adjustments:
    \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
    \clearpage
    \ifthenelse{\boolean{printquestions}}{\columnbreak}{}
    \drawexampleline
  Watch out for extra !
  put in \abs{}, \norm{}
  remove figures and source that are no longer used
  unitfrac
  js to enable highlighting
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break



Math typo:
p414 8.2 Theorem 60: part 1 is only true if $r\neq 1$.
p697 12.3 Example 407 Solution parts 1 & 2: In both, you have $f_{yx}=d/dx(f_x)$.
pA19 9.5#9b: x=√3/4, so these should be (x-√3/4).  (And in (a), you want $\theta$, not $t$.)

Typo:
p323 6.6#40: “multiply” is missing its first L.
p733 12.7 para-1 L-5: “it is _a_ general geometric concept”
p740 12.8 Definition 99 #3 L-1: “_an_ -a- absolute maximum”
p748 12.8 para3 L3 (1st displayed equation): V(wl) should be V(w,l)
