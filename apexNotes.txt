Ally complains that "This HTML file does not have a language set" and "This HTML file contains an invalid heading structure"

new prob, cf: 9.2#29: (4^n+5^n)/6^n

2.6#19 answer should be y’= (3x^2ycos(x^3)-sin(y^3))/(3xy^2cos(y^3)-sin(x^3))
get x.0 into pdf TOC sidebar
7.5: lots of exercises with answer 1, 0, or infinity.
8.3#25: √8
9.2#33 signs are swapped
9.8: give an example that requires some sort of reindexing
10.1#11 spacing is odd

prc html page please: need .prc
website pretty please: need [A-Z.]




is 2.5#4 ET?




Instead of “Note: these are the same functions as in Exercises ##—##”, should we just combine them into a single problem with multiple parts?

13.5: Multi-v chain rule: Example 1 rewrites dz/dt as only a function of the independent variable t.  Examples 2 through 5 leave dz/dt as functions of the independent and intermediate variables.  Exercises 19-22 do this as well.



html could do:
MBX conversion
http://aimath.org/knowlepedia/
ebook (epub?) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing ?)
ET version
js to enable highlighting?
use xslt to remove need for js when possible?
convert figs.asy to javascript
3d images
	three.js
	mine: https://sourceforge.net/p/asymptote/discussion/409349/thread/920f9769/
	“Asymptote can also produce any output format supported by the ImageMagick convert program”.  run “identify -list format” to see possibilities?
actual 3d via phone

Is it possible to display a three dimensional interactive Asymptote figure on a webpage?  Can asymptote export to X3DOM, WebGL, or three.js formats?

Or would you already be doing that in the gallery if that were possible?


All
Transitions into and out of each section.
remove all !?
sub figs?


possible examples:
4.4 Fast Inverse Square Root
8.2 Fourier series
8.6 Gamma function?
8.7 required n to achieve desired level of accuracy
9.2 rationalizing a repeating decimal
9.2 Riemann Zeta function?
9.10 examples from numerical integration
swing jump distance


Should the notebook be distributed with the text?  Eventually.  CC-BY-NC, same as Apex.



My to do:
  5.2: use something other than $\Delta x$ to represent a partition
  obsolete pre_package
  check units in center of mass calculations
  \exerciseset -> \begin{exerciseset} 423 times
  \example -> \begin{example} 596 times
  also theorems, definitions, and key ideas 363 times
  \ d, \,d, d become \dd
  rearrange text/ to have chapter subfolders? and figure???
  kill [over|under]full hboxes
  spellcheck:
	cat text/*tex | aspell list -t --ignore=3 --ignore-case --add-texinfo-ignore=youtubeVideo | sort | uniq > misspell.txt

  ifthen -> etoolbox ?
  use subfig
  flexible vertical page length??

  | to norm/abs
  Watch out for extra !
  unitfrac/siunitx(?) (or at least spaces before units). search:
	egrep -c '\dft\W' text/*tex | grep -v ':0$'
  vspace to addvspace, [small|med|big]skip to [small|med|big]break ?


Typos:

1.5#19: x>0 should be x\ne0
3.1 Theorem 3.1.1: $I$ should be a *finite* closed interval.
Example 3.5.2 Solution item 2: $(x^2+x-6)^2$ should be $(x^2-x-6)^2$.
4.1#2: Newtons’ should be Newton’s.
7.5 p387 para 2: If I understand things correctly, three occurrences of “Newton” should be “newton”.
7.5#1: If I understand things correctly, Newton-meter should be newton-meter.
7.5#27: “an truncated” should be “a truncated”.
8.4 Example 8.4.3#2: The summation should begin at 2.
\item The solution to \S9.4\#5 should specify the comparison ``for all $n\ge 3$''.
8.4 # 23, 24, 31, 33: ditto
8.8 Example 8.8.4, line -2: When -1<k<0, the interval of convergence is (-1,1].  (Indeed, (1+x)^k isn't defined when x=-1 and k<0.)
9.5 Example 9.5.7: The parameter starts as t, but then switches to theta.
