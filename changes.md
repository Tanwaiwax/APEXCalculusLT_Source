List Of Changes
=====================

Individual errors are detailed in [the errata directory](errata/)

Changes for the 2021-06 version:
--------------------

* The html version now includes 3d images that can be manipulated within the browser.  Chrome doesn't seem to handle MathJax well, so Firefox seems to be the way to go.

* Within 5.3, "Riemann Sums", $\Delta x$ usually represents the width of a subinterval.  It also occasionally represented a partition of the interval.  A partition is now represented by $P$.

* Example 8.7.8 has been introduced, showing how to calculate n in order to achieve a desired accuracy in the Trapezoidal Rule.

* New exercises include: 2.1#31-32, 2.5#39-46, 4.4#24, 6.1#21-24, 7.3#21-24, 8.3#13-26, 9.2#53-58, 9.8#33-44&46.
Except for 4.4, each has subsequent exercises whose numbering has consequently changed.  9.8 is the only section also involving a change in parity of problem numbers.

* (Due to various reasons, the 2020-07 version did not have wide adoption.  You may want to also look at the changes for that version.)

Changes for the 2020-07 version:
--------------------

* A careful reading of Definition 3.3.1 shows that intervals of increasing and decreasing are usually closed within their domain.  We often had open intervals instead.

* Definition 10.3.1 (Tangent line to a parametric curve) has been rearranged to no longer have an unnecessary "provided x'≠0".

* Anthony Bevelacqua and John Collings contributed several exercises.

* New exercises include: 5.4#65, 6.3#18,  
  7.1#33-37, 7.3#31, 7.4#3-4, 7.4#41, 7.5#53-55,  
  8.1#53-56, 8.2#41, 8.3#27, 8.4#33-34, 8.4#39, 8.6#47-48,  
  9.1#52-53, 9.2#54-55, 9.3#15, 9.4#34, 9.5#27-28, 9.6#27, 10.3#51.  
  Those in 6.3, 7.4, and 8.4 have subsequent exercises whose numbering has consequently changed.

* All known errata (31+) have been fixed.

* After a fair bit of work (and some sweeping under the rug), we are down to two overfull hboxes and 10 undervull vboxes.

Changes for the 2019-06 version:
--------------------

* The preface now has a link to a library of the 3d images.  This page also has instructions for using an Android or iOS app to interactively view the images.

* The preface also has a link to an html version of the book.  As far as accessibility goes, pdf can't hope to compete with html.

* The criteria for the first derivative test have been weakened.

* Exercise 3.3#39 proves enough of Darboux's theorem for Key Idea 3.3.1.

* New examples: 6.3 (Using the Washer and Shell Methods), 9.8 (Reindexing a Power Series)

* New exercises in Sections 7.1, 8.5 (tangent half-angle substitution).

* A corrected proof for Theorem 9.4.1.

* Taylor's Theorem has a stronger conclusion regarding the bound on the error term.

* All known errata (106+) have been fixed.

Changes for the 2018-07 version:
---------------------

* We now have Chapter 15 written by the same author.  It is completely rearranged:
  * 15.1->15.1&15.3
  * 15.2->15.2&15.3
  * 15.3->15.2&15.4
  * 15.4->15.5,15.6,15.7
  * 15.5->15.1,15.3,15.7
  * 15.6(some)->15.2

* For the same reasons, Section 11.7 has moved to the beginning of Section 14.7.

* Some exercises have been added (and occasionally subtracted) throughout.  (The purpose of this was partly to make exercise sets with common instructions start with an odd number and end with an even, so that future changes won’t have to adjust the exercises’ parity.)

* By request of Chemistry, Section 13.7 has a short subsection on Taylor polynomials for f:R^2 -> R.

* Suppose f'(c)=0. Previously, we defined (c,f(c)) as the critical point, but were inconsistent about using point, value, or number.  To match 265, we are defining c as the critical point, and f(c) as the critical value.

* The previous numbering was:
  * Theorem/Key Idea/Definition: #
  * Figure: chap.#
  * Example in same section: #
  * Example in other section: chap.sec.#  
  These have all been changed to the last format: chap.sec.#

* All known errata (54+) have been fixed.
