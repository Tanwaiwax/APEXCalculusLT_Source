List Of Changes
=====================

Changes for the 2020-06 version:
--------------------

* A careful reading of Definition 3.3.1 shows that intervals of increasing and decreasing are usually closed within the domain.  We often had open intervals instead.

* Definition 10.3.1 (Tangent line to a parametric curve) has been rearranged to no longer have an unnecessary "provided x'≠0".

* Anthony Bevelacqua and John Collings contributed several exercises.

* All known errata (20+) have been fixed.

Changes for the 2019-06 version:
--------------------

* The preface now has a link to a library of the 3d images.  This page also has instructions for using an Android or iOS app to interactively view the images.

* The preface also has a link to an html version of the book.  As far as accessibility goes, pdf can't hope to compete with html.

* The criteria for the first derivative test have been weakened.

* Exercise 3.3#39 proves enough of Darboux's theorem for Key Idea 3.3.1.

* New examples: 6.3 (Using the Washer and Shell Methods), 9.8 (Reindexing a Power Series)

* New exercises in Sections 7.1, 8.5 (tangent half-angle substitution).

* A corrected proof for Theorem 9.4.1.

* Taylor's Theorem has a stronger conclusion regarding the bound on the error term.

* All known errata (106+) have been fixed.

Changes for the 2018-07 version:
---------------------

* We now have Chapter 15 written by the same author.  It is completely rearranged:
  * 15.1->15.1&15.3
  * 15.2->15.2&15.3
  * 15.3->15.2&15.4
  * 15.4->15.5,15.6,15.7
  * 15.5->15.1,15.3,15.7
  * 15.6(some)->15.2

* For the same reasons, Section 11.7 has moved to the beginning of Section 14.7.

* Some exercises have been added (and occasionally subtracted) throughout.  (The purpose of this was partly to make exercise sets with common instructions start with an odd number and end with an even, so that future changes won’t have to adjust the exercises’ parity.)

* By request of Chemistry, Section 13.7 has a short subsection on Taylor polynomials for f:R^2 -> R.

* Suppose f'(c)=0. Previously, we defined (c,f(c)) as the critical point, but were inconsistent about using point, value, or number.  To match 265, we are defining c as the critical point, and f(c) as the critical value.

* The previous numbering was:
  * Theorem/Key Idea/Definition: #
  * Figure: chap.#
  * Example in same section: #
  * Example in other section: chap.sec.#  
  These have all been changed to the last format: chap.sec.#

* All known errata (54+) have been fixed.
