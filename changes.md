List Of Changes
=====================

Changes for the 2018-06-?? version:
---------------------

* Section 11.7 has moved to the beginning of Section 14.7.

* We now have Chapter 15 written by the same author.  It is completely rearranged:
  * 15.1->15.1&15.3
  * 15.2->15.2&15.3
  * 15.3->15.2&15.4
  * 15.4->15.5,15.6,15.7
  * 15.5->15.1,15.3,15.7
  * 15.6(some)->15.2

* By request of Chemistry, Section 13.7 has a short subsection on Taylor polynomials for f:R^2 -> R.

* Suppose f'(c)=0. Previously, we defined (c,f(c)) as the critical point, but were inconsistent about using point, value, or number.  To match 265, we are defining c as the critical point, and f(c) as the critical value.

* Some exercises have been added (and occasionally subtracted) throughout.  (The purpose of this was partly to make exercise sets with common instructions start with an odd number and end with an even, so that future changes won’t have to adjust the exercises’ parity.)

* The previous numbering was:
  * Theorem/Key Idea/Definition: #
  * Figure: chap.#
  * Example in same section: #
  * Example in other section: chap.sec.#  
  These have all been changed to the last format: chap.sec.#

* All known errata (54+) have been fixed.
