Errata Totals
=====================

If you are interested in a particular error, you can look through [Errata.tex](Errata.tex) (or compile it to Errata.pdf). That will also list the total number of errors for each edition, which we repeat here:

Version | Calculus I | Calculus II | Calculuc III
---|---|---|---

"+" indicates a systemic error.  
(The totals for a row may be higher than what's listed in [changes.md](../changes.md) due to double counting.)
