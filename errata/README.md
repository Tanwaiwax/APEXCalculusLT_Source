Errata Totals
=====================

If you are interested in a particular error, you can look through [Errata.tex](Errata.tex) (or compile it to Errata.pdf). That will also list the total number of errors for each edition, which we repeat here:

Version | Calculus I | Calculus II | Calculuc III
---|---|---|---
2023-06-00|2||
2021-06-00|2|30|10
2019-06-00|6+|7|22
2018-07-13|47|56+|13+
2017-11-13|||12+
2017-07-27|10+|32+|10
2017-05-00|1|2|36+
2017-01-00|9+|19+|
2016-08-00|19+||
---|---|---|---
Total|96+|146+|103+

"+" indicates a systemic error.  
(The totals for a row may be higher than what's listed in [changes.md](../changes.md) due to double counting.)
