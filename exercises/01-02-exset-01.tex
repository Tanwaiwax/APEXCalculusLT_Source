\exercise{What is wrong with the following ``definition'' of a limit?
	\begin{quote}
``The limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $a$, is $K$'' means that given any $\delta>0$ there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that whenever $\abs{f(x)-K}< \epsilon$, we have $\abs{x-a}<\delta$.
	\end{quote}
}{$\epsilon$ should be given first, and the restriction 	$\abs{x-a}<\delta$ implies $\abs{f(x)-K}< \epsilon$, not the other way around.}

\exercise{Which is given first in establishing a limit, the $x$-tolerance or the $y$-tolerance?}{The $y$-tolerance.}
