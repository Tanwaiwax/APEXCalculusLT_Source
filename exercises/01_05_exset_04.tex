\exercise{$f(x) = x^2+2x-4$% on $[1,1.5]$.
}{Use the Bisection Method with an appropriate interval.
%Approximate root is $x=1.23$. The intervals used are:
%$[1,1.5] \quad [1,1.25] \quad [1.125,1.25]$
%$[1.1875,1.25]\quad [1.21875,1.25]\quad [1.234375,1.25]$
%$[1.234375,1.2421875]\quad [1.234375,1.2382813]$
}

\exercise{$f(x) = \sin x - 1/2$% on $[0.5,0.55]$
}{Use the Bisection Method with an appropriate interval.
%Approximate root is $x=0.52$. The intervals used are:
%$[0.5,0.55] \quad [0.5,0.525] \quad [0.5125,0.525]$
%$[0.51875,0.525]\quad [0.521875,0.525]$
}

\exercise{$f(x) = e^x - 2$% on $[0.65,0.7]$.
}{Use the Bisection Method with an appropriate interval.
%Approximate root is $x=0.69$. The intervals used are:
%$[0.65,0.7] \quad [0.675,0.7] \quad [0.6875,0.7]$
%$[0.6875,0.69375]\quad [0.690625,0.69375]$
}

\exercise{$f(x) = \cos x -\sin x$% on $[0.7,0.8]$.
}{Use the Bisection Method with an appropriate interval.
%Approximate root is $x=0.78$. The intervals used are:
%$[0.7,0.8] \quad [0.75,0.8] \quad [0.775,0.8]$
%$[0.775,0.7875]\quad [0.78125,0.7875]$
%
%(A few more steps show that $0.79$ is better as the root is $\pi/4 \approx 0.78539$.)
