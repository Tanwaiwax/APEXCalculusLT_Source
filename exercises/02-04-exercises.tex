%\exercise{Given that $e^0=1$, approximate the value of $e^{0.1}$ using the tangent line to $f(x) = e^x$ at $x=0$.}{The tangent line to $f(x) = e^x$ at $x=0$ is $y=x+1$; thus $e^{0.1} \approx y(0.1) = 1.1$. }

%\exercise{Approximate the value of $(3.01)^4$ using the tangent line to $f(x) = x^4$ at $x=3$.}{The tangent line to $f(x) = x^4$ at $x=3$ is $y=108(x-3)+81$; thus $(3.01)^4 \approx y(3.01) = 108(.01)+81 = 82.08$. }
