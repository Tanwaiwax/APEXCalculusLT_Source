\exercise{Show that $\ds \frac{\dd y}{\dd x}$ is the same for each of the following implicitly defined functions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		$xy=1$
\item		$x^2y^2=1$
\item		$\sin(xy) = 1$
\item		$\ln (xy) =1$
\end{enumerate}}{In each, $\frac{\dd y}{\dd x} = -\frac yx$.}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item		Using the Chain Rule, and 
%\item		by first using the logarithm rule $\ln (ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, then taking the derivative.

%\exercise{The ``wind chill factor'' is a measurement of how cold it ``feels'' during cold, windy weather. Let $W(w)$ be the wind chill factor, in degrees Fahrenheit, when it is $25^\circ$F outside with a wind of $w$ mph. 
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item		What are the units of $W\primeskip'(w)$?
%	\item		What would you expect the sign of $W\primeskip'(10)$ to be?
%	\end{enumerate}
%}{\begin{enumerate}
%\item		$^\circ$ F/mph
%\item		The sign would be negative; when the wind is blowing at 10 mph, any increase in wind speed will make it feel colder, i.e., a lower number on the Fahrenheit scale.
