{The position of a object is described by $s(t)=5e^t-5t$, where $s$ is in inches and $t$ is in seconds. Find
\begin{enumerate}
\item the velocity and acceleration functions for the object,
\item the acceleration after 2 seconds, and
\item the acceleration when the object is at rest.
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item $v(t) = 5e^x-5$, $a(t)=5e^x$
\item $a(2) = 5e^2~ \text{ft/s}^2$\\  
\item $v(t)=0$ at $t=0$ sec, $a(0)=5~ \text{in/s}^2$ 
\end{enumerate}}
