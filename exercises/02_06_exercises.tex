%\exercise{The ``wind chill factor'' is a measurement of how cold it ``feels'' during cold, windy weather. Let $W(w)$ be the wind chill factor, in degrees Fahrenheit, when it is $25^\circ$F outside with a wind of $w$ mph. 
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item		What are the units of $W\primeskip'(w)$?
%	\item		What would you expect the sign of $W\primeskip'(10)$ to be?
%	\end{enumerate}
%}{\begin{enumerate}
%\item		$^\circ$ F/mph
%\item		The sign would be negative; when the wind is blowing at 10 mph, any increase in wind speed will make it feel colder, i.e., a lower number on the Fahrenheit scale.
