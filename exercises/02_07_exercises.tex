\exercise{A regulation hockey goal is 6 feet wide. If a player is skating towards the end line on a line perpendicular to the end line and 10 feet from the imaginary line joining the center of one goal to the center of the other, the angle between the player and the goal first increases and then begins to decrease. In order to maximize this angle, how far from the end line should the player be when they shoot the puck?
