\exercise{Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$, where $x^2y-y^2x = 1$.}{ $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y (y-2 x)}{x (x-2 y)}$}

\exercise{Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of\\
$x^2+y^2+xy=7$ at the point $(1,2)$.}{$y=-\frac45(x-1)+2$}

\exercise{Let $f(x) = x^3+x$. Evaluate $\ds \lim_{s\to 0} \frac{f(x+s)-f(x)}{s}$.}{ $3x^2+1$}

%\exercise{Approximate the value of $(3.01)^4$ using the tangent line to $f(x) = x^4$ at $x=3$.}{The tangent line to $f(x) = x^4$ at $x=3$ is $y=108(x-3)+81$; thus $(3.01)^4 \approx y(3.01) = 108(.01)+81 = 82.08$. }
