{A cubic function is a polynomial of degree 3; that is, it has the form $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, where $a\neq 0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that a cubic function can have 2, 1, or 0 critical numbers.  Give examples and sketches to illustrate the 3 possibilities.
\item How many local extreme values can a cubic function have?
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}\item $x^3-x$, $x^3$, and $x^3+x$ have 2, 1, and 0 critical numbers respectively.  Because the derivative is a quadratic with at most 2 roots, a cubic cannot have 3 or more critical numbers.
\item A cubic can only have 2 or 0 extreme values.
\end{enumerate}}
