\exercise{The\label{exer:04_04_ex_35} length $l$ of a long wall is to be approximated. The angle $\theta$, as shown in the diagram (not to scale), is measured to be $85.2^\circ$, accurate to $1^\circ$. Assume that the triangle formed is a right triangle.\\

%\exercise{The length of the walls in Exercises~\ref{exer:04_04_ex_35}--\ref{exer:04_04_ex_34} are essentially the same. Which setup gives the most accurate result?}{The isosceles triangle setup works the best with the smallest percent error.}

\exercise{Consider the setup in \autoref{exer:04_04_ex_34}. This time, assume the angle measurement of $143^\circ$ is exact but the measured $50'$ from the wall is accurate to $6''$. What is the approximate percent error?}{1\%}
