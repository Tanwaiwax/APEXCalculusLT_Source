{Four squares are going to be cut from a larger square piece of paper of side length 10 inches.  After the paper is folded into a topless box, what is the largest volume the box could have?
}
{The largest volume is 62.5 in$^3$ formed by cutting 2.5 in squares at each corner.}

% V = x(10-2x)^2
% V' = (10-2x)^2+x(10-2x)(-2)
%    = (10-2x)(10-2x-2x)
%    = (10-2x)(10-4x)
% x=5/2
% V(5/2) = (5/2)(10-2(5/2))^2
%        = (5/2)(10-5)^2
%        = (5/2)25 = 125/2 = 62.5
