{A nickel dropped from the top of the North Dakota State Capital Building has acceleration $a(t)=-32$ ft/sec$^2$ (ignoring air resistance), initial velocity $v(0)=0$, and initial height $s(0)=241.67$ ft. How long will it take the nickel to hit the ground?}
{$s(t)=241.67-16t^2$ ft, so $s(t)=0$ at $t=3.89$sec.}
