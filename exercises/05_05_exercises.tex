\exercise{T/F: Simpson's Rule is a method of approximating antiderivatives.}{F}

\exercise{What are the two basic situations where approximating the value of a definite integral is necessary?}{When the antiderivative cannot be computed and when the integrand is unknown.}

\exercise{Why are the Left and Right Hand Rules rarely used?}{They are superseded by the Trapezoidal Rule; it takes an equal amount of work and is generally more accurate.}

\exercise{Why is the Midpoint Rule rarely used?}{It is superseded by the Trapezoidal Rule; it is about as accurate, but takes more work.}

\exercise{Let $f$ be the quadratic function that goes through the points $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_1+\Delta x,y_2)$ and $(x_1+2\Delta x,y_3)$.  Show that $\ds\int_{x_1}^{x_1+2\Delta x}f(x)\dd x=\frac{\Delta x}3(y_1+4y_2+y_3)$.}{Let $f(x)=a(x-x_1)^2+b(x-x_1)+c$, so that $f(x_1)=c=y_1$, $f(x_1+\Delta x)=a\Delta x^2+b\Delta x+c=y_2$, and $f(x_1+2\Delta x)=4a\Delta x^2+2b\Delta x+c=y_3$.  Therefore, $a=\frac{y_1-2y_2+y_3}{2(\Delta x)^2}$ and $b=\frac{4y_2-y_3-3y_1}{2\Delta x}$, and $\ds\int_{x_1}^{x_1+2\Delta x}a(x-x_1)^2+b(x-x_1)+c\dd x=\frac{a(2\Delta x)^3}3+\frac{b(2\Delta x)^2}2+c(2\Delta x)=\frac{4(y_1-2y_2+y_3)\Delta x}3+(4y_2-y_3-3y_1)\Delta x+2y_1\Delta x=\frac{\Delta x}3(4y_1-8y_2+4y_3+12y_2-3y_3-9y_1+6y_1)=\frac{\Delta x}3(y_1+4y_2+y_3)$.}
