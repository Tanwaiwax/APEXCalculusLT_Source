\exercise{T/F: $\ds \int \sin^2x\cos^2x \dd x$ cannot be evaluated using the techniques described in this section since both powers of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are even.}{F}

\exercise{T/F: $\ds \int \sin^3x\cos^3x \dd x$ cannot be evaluated using the techniques described in this section since both powers of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are odd.}{F}

\exercise{T/F: This section addresses how to evaluate indefinite integrals such as $\ds \int \sin^5x\tan^3x\dd x.$}{F}

\exercise{T/F: Sometimes computer programs evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions differently than one would using the techniques of this section. When this is the case, the techniques of this section have failed and one should only trust the answer given by the computer.}{F}
