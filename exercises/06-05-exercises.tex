\exercise{In \autoref{idea:hyperbolic_identities}, the equation $\ds \int \tanh x\dd x = \ln (\cosh x)+C$ is given. Why is ``$\ln\abs{\cosh x}$'' not used --- i.e., why are absolute values not necessary?}{Because $\cosh x$ is always positive.}

\exercise{The hyperbolic functions are used to define points on the right hand portion of the hyperbola $x^2-y^2=1$, as shown in \autoref{fig:hfcircle}. How can we use the hyperbolic functions to define points on the left hand portion of the hyperbola?}{The points on the left hand side can be defined as $(-\cosh x, \sinh x)$.}

\exercise{In the bottom graph of \autoref{fig:hfcircle} (the hyperbola), it is stated that the shaded area is $\theta/2$. Verify this claim by setting up and evaluating an appropriate integral (and note that $\theta$ is just a positive number, not an angle).\\
Hint: Integrate with respect to y, and consult the table of Integration Rules in the Appendix if necessary.}{Using rule \#33: $A=\int_0^{\sinh\theta}\sqrt{1+y^2}-y\coth\theta\dd y
%=\frac12[y\sqrt{y^2+1}+\ln\left(y+\sqrt{y^2+1}\right)-y^2\coth\theta]_0^{\sinh\theta}
%=\frac12[\sinh\theta\cosh\theta+\ln\left(\sinh\theta+\cosh\theta\right)
%-\sinh^2\theta\coth\theta]
%=\frac12[\sinh\theta\cosh\theta+\ln e^\theta-\sinh\theta\cosh\theta]
=\frac\theta2$.}
