\exercise{\mbox{}\\[-2\baselineskip]\begin{enumerate}
 \item  For $n\geq2$ show that
 \[
  \int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^n x\ dx = \frac{n-1}n \int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^{n-2} x\,dx.
 \]
 Hint:  Begin by writing $\sin^n x$ as $(\sin^{n-1} x) \sin x$ and using Integration by Parts.
 \item  For $k \geq 1$ show that
 \begin{align*}
  \int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^{2k+1}x\ dx&=\frac{2\cdot4\cdot6\dotsm(2k)}{1\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\dotsm(2k+1)}\qquad\text{and}\\
  \int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^{2k}x\ dx&=\frac{1\cdot3\cdot5\dotsm(2k-1)}{2\cdot4\cdot6\dotsm(2k)}\frac\pi2.
