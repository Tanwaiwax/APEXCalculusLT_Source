\exercise{In Key Idea \ref{idea:hyperbolic_identities}, the equation $\ds \int \tanh x\ dx = \ln (\cosh x)+C$ is given. Why is ``$\ln |\cosh x|$'' not used -- i.e., why are absolute values not necessary?}{Because $\cosh x$ is always positive.}

\exercise{The hyperbolic functions are used to define points on the right hand portion of the hyperbola $x^2-y^2=1$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hfcircle}. How can we use the hyperbolic functions to define points on the left hand portion of the hyperbola?}{The points on the left hand side can be defined as $(-\cosh x, \sinh x)$.}
