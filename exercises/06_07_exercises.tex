\exercise{In probability theory, the lifetimes of certain devices (e.g. certain types of fuses and light bulbs) are modeled by an \emph{Exponential Distribution}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability that a device lasts more than $a$ (time units) is $\int_a^\infty\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\ dx$ where $\lambda$ is a parameter that depends on the type of device. Evaluate this integral.
\item The expected lifetime of the device is given by $\int_0^\infty x\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\ dx$. Evaluate this integral.
\item What is the probability that a given device lasts more than the expected lifetime for such devices?
\end{enumerate}}{\mbox{}\\[-2\baselineskip]\begin{enumerate}
\item $e^{-\lambda a}$
\item $\frac1\lambda$
\item $e^{-1}$
\end{enumerate}}
