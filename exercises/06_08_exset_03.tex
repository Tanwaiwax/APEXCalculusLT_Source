\exerciseset{In Exercises}{,  evaluate the definite integrals by making the proper trigonometric substitution \emph{and} changing the bounds of integration.% (Note: each of the corresponding indefinite integrals has appeared previously in this Exercise set.)

\exercise{$\ds \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\ dx$}{$\pi/2$}

\exercise{$\ds \int_{4}^8 \sqrt{x^2-16}\ dx$}{$16\sqrt3-8\ln(2+\sqrt3)$}

\exercise{$\ds \int_{0}^2 \sqrt{x^2+4}\ dx$}{$2\sqrt2+2\ln(1+\sqrt2)$}

\exercise{$\ds \int_{-1}^1 \frac1{(x^2+1)^2}\ dx$}{$\pi/4+1/2)$}

\exercise{$\ds \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{9-x^2}\ dx$}{$9\sin^{-1}(1/3)+\sqrt{8}$\quad Note: the new bounds of integration are $\sin^{-1}(-1/3)<\theta<\sin^{-1}(1/3)$. The final answer comes with recognizing that $\sin^{-1}(-1/3)=-\sin^{-1}(1/3)$ and that $\cos\big(\sin^{-1}(1/3)\big)=\cos\big(\sin^{-1}(-1/3)\big) = \sqrt{8}/3$.}
