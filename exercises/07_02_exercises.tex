\exercise{In your own words, explain how the Disk and Washer Methods are related.}{Answers will vary.}

\exercise{Explain the how the units of volume are found in the integral of \autoref{thm:volume_by_cross_section}: if $A(x)$ has units of in$^2$, how does $\int A(x)\ dx$ have units of in$^3$?}{Recall that ``$dx$'' does not just ``sit there;'' it is multiplied by $A(x)$ and represents the thickness of a small slice of the solid. Therefore $dx$ has units of in, giving $A(x)\ dx$ the units of in$^3$.}

\exercise{A fundamental principle of this section is ``\underline{\hskip .5in} can be found by integrating an area function.''}{volume}
