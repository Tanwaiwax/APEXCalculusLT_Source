\exercise{Find the two values of $n$ so that the function $y=e^{nx}$ satisfies the differential equation $y\primeskip''+y\primeskip'-6y=0$.}{$n=-3,2$}

\exercise{Let $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=2^x$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since $f(2)=2^2=4$ and $g(2)=2^2=4$, $f(2)=g(2)$. Find a positive number $c>2$ so that $f(c)=g(c)$.
\item Explain how you can be sure that there is at least one negative number $a$ so that $f(a)=g(a)$.
\item Use the Bisection Method to estimate the number $a$ accurate to within $.05$.
\item Assume you were to graph $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ on the same graph with unit length equal to 1 inch along both coordinate axes. Approximately how high is the graph of $f$ when $x=18$? The graph of $g$?
\end{enumerate}}{\mbox{}\\[-2\baselineskip]\begin{enumerate}
\item $c=4$
\item Since $g(0)-f(0)=1-0>0$ and $g(-1)-f(-1)=\frac12-1<0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem implies that there is a number $a$ between $-1$ and $0$ so that $g(a)-f(a)=0$, or $g(a)=f(a)$.
\item $-\frac{25}{32}$
\item $f(18)=18^2=324$, so the graph of $f$ is 27 feet high.\\
$g(18)=2^{18}=262{,}144$, so the graph of $g$ is approximately $4.14$ miles high. 
\end{enumerate}}
