\exercise{We know that the harmonic series $1+\frac12+\frac13+\frac14+\dots$ diverges. Suppose we remove some terms by considering the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1{F_n}$ where $F_n$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number (so $F_1=1$, $F_2=1$, $F_3=2$, $F_4=3$, $F_5=5$, \dots, and in general $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for $n\ge3$). Determine if this series converges or diverges, using the fact that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\phi$ where $\phi=\frac12(1+\sqrt5)$ is known as the Golden Ratio.}{Converges}
