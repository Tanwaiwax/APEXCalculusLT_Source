\exercise{Prove \autoref{thm:abs_val_seq}; that is, use the definition of the limit of a sequence to show that if $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{a_n} = 0$, then $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$.}{Let $\{a_n\}$ be given such that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{a_n} = 0$. By the definition of the limit of a sequence, given any $\epsilon >0$, there is a $m$ such that for all $n>m, \abs{\ \abs{a_n} - 0} <\epsilon$. Since $\abs{\ \abs{a_n}-0} = \abs{a_n - 0}$, this directly implies that for all $n>m$, $\abs{a_n - 0} < \epsilon$, meaning that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$.}

% I'm doubtful Calc 2 students would be able to prove the equivalence of two theorems
%\exercise{Prove the statement ``Let $\{a_n\}$ be a bounded, monotonic sequence. Then $\{a_n\}$ converges; i.e., $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$ exists.'' is equivalent to \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge}. That is,
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Show that if \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge} is true, then above statement is true, and
%	\item Show that if the above statement is true, then \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge} is true.
%\end{enumerate}}{A sketch of one proof method:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Assume that \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge} is true, and let $\{a_n\}$ be bounded and monotonic. Since $\{a_n\}$ is bounded, it is bounded both above and below. If it is increasing, it is bounded above and we apply \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge}; if it is decreasing, it is bounded below and we apply the theorem. Either way, $\{a_n\}$ converges and the statement is true.
%	\item Assume the statement is true, and let $\{a_n\}$ be a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above. Since $\{a_n\}$ is monotonically increasing, $a_1\leq a_2\leq \ldots$; that is, $a_1$ bounds $\{a_n\}$ from below. Therefore $\{a_n\}$ is bounded and monotonic; by the statement, $\{a_n\}$ converges. A similar statement can be made for when $\{a_n\}$ is monotonically decreasing and bounded below. Therefore \autoref{thm:monotonic_converge} is true.
