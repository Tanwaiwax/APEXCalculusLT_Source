\exercise{What test(s) in this section do not work well with factorials?}{The Integral Test (we do not have a continuous definition of $n!$ yet) and the Limit Comparison Test (same as above, hence we cannot take its derivative).}

%\exercise{Suppose $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ is convergent, and there are sequences $\{b_n\}$ and $\{c_n\}$ such that $b_n \leq a_n \leq c_n$ for all $n$. What can be said about the series $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ and $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n$?}{$\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ converges; we cannot conclude anything about $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n$}

%\exercise{Given that $\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges, state which of the following series converges, may converge, or does not converge.
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item $\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}n$
%	\item	$\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_na_{n+1}$
%	\item	$\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n)^2$
%	\item $\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n$
%	\item	$\ds \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_n}$
%\end{enumerate}
%}{\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Converges; use Direct Comparison Test as $\frac{a_n}{n}<n$.
%	\item	Converges; since original series converges, we know $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = 0$. Thus for large $n$, $a_na_{n+1} < a_n$.
%	\item		Converges; similar logic to part (b) so $(a_n)^2<a_n$.
%	\item		May converge; certainly $na_n > a_n$ but that does not mean it does not converge.
%	\item		Does not converge, using logic from (b) and $n^{th}$ Term Test.
