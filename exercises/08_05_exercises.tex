\exercise{Why is $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin n$ not an alternating series?}{The signs of the terms do not alternate; in the given series, some terms are negative and the others positive, but they do not necessarily alternate.}

\exercise{A series  $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^na_n$ converges when $\{a_n\}$ is \underlinespace, \underlinespace\ and $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = $\underlinespace.\vspace{-.5\baselineskip}}{positive, decreasing, 0}

\exercise{Give an example of a series where\vspace{-.5\baselineskip} $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ converges but $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty\abs{a_n}$ does not.}{Many examples exist; one common example is $a_n = (-1)^n/n$.}

\exercise{The sum of a \underlinespace\ convergent series can be changed by rearranging the order of its terms.}{conditionally}

\exercise{The partial sums in problems \ref{pi_fourth} and \ref{pi_alt} can be used to approximate $\pi$. Using the values of $n$ from these problems, compute the respective partial sums and then use them to approximate $\pi$. Which gives a better estimate of $\pi$?}{Using 5 terms, the series in 23 gives $\pi\approx3.142013$. Using 499 terms, the series in 25 gives $\pi\approx3.143597$. The series in 23 gives the better approximation, and requires many fewer terms.}

\exercise{The book shows a rearrangement of the Alternating Harmonic Series,
\[
 \left(1-\frac12\right)-\frac14+
 \left(\frac13-\frac16\right)-\frac18+
 \left(\frac15-\frac1{10}\right)-\frac1{12}+\dots
\]
which gives the sum $\frac12 \ln 2$. Note that the terms in parentheses are positive, so if we simplified those terms we would have an alternating series. Without actually simplifying, show that the same scheme of rearranging terms so that each positive term is followed by two successive negative terms yields
\begin{multline*}
 \left(1-\frac12\right)-\frac14-\frac18+
 \left(\frac13-\frac16\right)-\frac1{12}-\frac1{16}+\\
 \left(\frac15-\frac1{10}\right)-\frac1{20}-\frac1{24}+\dots
\end{multline*}
and then show that this new rearrangement of the Alternating Harmonic Series has the sum $\frac14 \ln 2$.\\
Hint: move each right parenthesis one term to the right and then simplify inside the parentheses.}{}
