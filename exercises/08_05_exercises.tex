\exercise{Why is $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin n$ not an alternating series?}{The signs of the terms do not alternate; in the given series, some terms are negative and the others positive, but they do not necessarily alternate.}

\exercise{A series  $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^na_n$ converges when $\{a_n\}$ is \underlinespace, \underlinespace\ and $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = $\underlinespace. }{positive, decreasing, 0}

\exercise{Give an example of a series where $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ converges but $\ds \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n|$ does not.}{Many examples exist; one common example is $a_n = (-1)^n/n$.}

\exercise{The sum of a \underlinespace\ convergent series can be changed by rearranging the order of its terms.}{conditionally}
