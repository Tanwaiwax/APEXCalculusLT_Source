\exercise{What is the difference between a Taylor polynomial and a Maclaurin polynomial?}{The Maclaurin polynomial is a special case of Taylor polynomials. Taylor polynomials are centered at a specific $x$-value; when that $x$-value is 0, it is a Maclaurin polynomial.}

\exercise{T/F: In general, $p_n(x)$ approximates $f(x)$ better and better as $n$ gets larger.}{T}

\exercise{For some function $f(x)$, the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4 is $p_4(x) = 6+3x-4x^2+5x^3-7x^4$. What is $p_2(x)$?}{$p_2(x) = 6+3x-4x^2$.}

\exercise{For some function $f(x)$, the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4 is $p_4(x) = 6+3x-4x^2+5x^3-7x^4$. What is $\fpp'(0)$?}{$\fpp'(0)=30$}
