\exercise{Approximate $\sin 0.1$ with the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 3.}{$p_3(x) =x-\frac{x^3}{6}$; $p_3(0.1) = 0.09983$. Error is bounded by $\frac{1}{4!}\cdot0.1^4 \approx 0.000004167$.}

\exercise{Approximate $\cos 1$ with the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4.}{$p_4(x) =1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}$; $p_4(1) = 13/24\approx 0.54167$. Error is bounded by $\frac{1}{5!}\cdot1^5 \approx 0.00833$.}

\exercise{Approximate $\sqrt{10}$ with the Taylor polynomial of degree 2 centered at $x=9$.}{$p_2(x) =3+\frac{1}{6} (-9+x)-\frac{1}{216} (-9+x)^2$; $p_2(10) =  3.16204$. The third derivative of $f(x) =\sqrt x$ is bounded on $[9,10]$ by $0.0015$. Error is bounded by $\frac{0.0015}{3!}\cdot1^3 = 0.0003$.}

\exercise{Approximate $\ln1.5$ with the Taylor polynomial of degree 3 centered at $x=1$.}{$p_3(x) =-1+x-\frac{1}{2} (-1+x)^2+\frac{1}{3} (-1+x)^3$; $p_3(1.5) =  0.41667$. The absolute value of the fourth derivative of $f(x) =\ln x$ is bounded on $[1,1.5]$ by $6$. Error is bounded by $\frac{6}{4!}\cdot.5^4 = 0.016$.}
