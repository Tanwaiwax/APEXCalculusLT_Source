\exercise{Approximate $\sin 0.1$ with the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 3.
}{$p_3(x) =x-\frac{x^3}{6}$; $p_3(0.1) = 0.09983$. Error is bounded by $\pm \frac{1}{4!}\cdot0.1^4 \approx \pm 0.000004167$.
}
\exercise{Approximate $\cos 1$ with the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4.
}{$p_4(x) =1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}$; $p_4(1) = 13/24\approx 0.54167$. Error is bounded by $\pm \frac{1}{5!}\cdot1^5 \approx \pm 0.00833$
}
\exercise{Approximate $\sqrt{10}$ with the Taylor polynomial of degree 2 centered at $x=9$.
}{$p_2(x) =3+\frac{1}{6} (-9+x)-\frac{1}{216} (-9+x)^2$; $p_2(10) =  3.16204$. The third derivative of $f(x) =\sqrt x$ is bounded on $(8,11)$ by $0.003$. Error is bounded by $\pm \frac{0.003}{3!}\cdot1^3 = \pm 0.0005.$
}
\exercise{Approximate $\ln1.5$ with the Taylor polynomial of degree 3 centered at $x=1$.
}{$p_3(x) =-1+x-\frac{1}{2} (-1+x)^2+\frac{1}{3} (-1+x)^3$; $p_3(1.5) =  0.41667$. The fourth derivative of $f(x) =\ln x$ is bounded on $(.9,2)$ by $10$. Error is bounded by $\pm \frac{10}{4!}\cdot.5^4 = \pm 0.026.$
