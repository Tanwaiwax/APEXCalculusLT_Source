\begin{exerciseset}{In Exercises}{, the equation of a parabola and a point on its graph are given. Find the focus and directrix of the parabola, and verify that the given point is equidistant from the focus and directrix.}

\exercise{$y=\frac14x^2$, $P=(2,1)$}{focus: $(0,1)$; directrix: $y=-1$. The point $P$ is 2 units from each.}

\exercise{$x=\frac18(y-2)^2+3$, $P=(11,10)$}{focus: $(5,2)$; directrix: $x=1$. The point $P$ is 10 units from each.}
