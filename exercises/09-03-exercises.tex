% todo write area enclosed by parametric curves problems

\exercise{Find the area under the curve given by the parametric equations $x=\cosh t$, $y=\sinh t$, for $0\le t\le\theta$. Subtract this area from the area of an appropriate triangle to verify the shaded area in the bottom graph of \autoref{fig:hfcircle}.}{$\frac12\sinh\theta\cosh\theta-\frac12\theta$}
