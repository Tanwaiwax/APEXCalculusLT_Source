\exercise{Given polar equation $r=f(\theta)$, how can one create parametric equations of the same curve?}{Using $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$, we can write $x=f(\theta)\cos\theta$, $y=f(\theta)\sin\theta$.}

\exercise{With rectangular coordinates, it is natural to approximate area with \underline{\hskip .5in}; with polar coordinates, it is natural to approximate area with \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{rectangles; sectors of circles}
