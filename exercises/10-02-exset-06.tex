In Exercises]{, a force $\vec F_w$ and length $\ell$ are given. Find the angle $\theta$ and the height the weight is lifted as it moves to the right.}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 1$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb}{$\theta = 45^\circ$; the weight is lifted $0.29$ ft (about 3.5in).}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 1$ft, \quad $p = 10$lb}{$\theta = 5.71^\circ$; the weight is lifted $0.005$ ft (about 1/16th of an inch).}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 10$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb}{$\theta = 45^\circ$; the weight is lifted $2.93$ ft.}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=10$lb, \quad $\ell = 10$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb}{$\theta = 84.29^\circ$; the weight is lifted $9$ ft.}
