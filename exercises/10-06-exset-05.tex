\exercisesetinstructions{, find the point of intersection between the line and the plane.}

\exercise{line: $\bracket{5,1,-1}+ t\bracket{2,2,1}$,\\
plane: $5x-y-z=-3$}{$(-3,-7,-5)$}

\exercise{line: $\bracket{4,1,0}+ t\bracket{1,0,-1}$,\\
plane: $3x+y-2z=8$}{$(3,1,1)$}

\exercise{line: $\bracket{1,2,3}+ t\bracket{3,5,-1}$,\\
plane: $3x-2y-z=4$}{No point of intersection; the plane and line are parallel.}

\exercise{line: $\bracket{1,2,3}+ t\bracket{3,5,-1}$,\\
plane: $3x-2y-z=-4$}{The plane contains the line, so every point on the line is a ``point of intersection.''}
