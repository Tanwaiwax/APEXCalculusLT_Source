\exercise{The points $A=(1,4,2)$, $B=(2,6,3)$ and $C=(4,3,1)$ form a triangle in space. Find the distances between each pair of points and determine if the triangle is a right triangle.}{$\norm{\overline{AB}} = \sqrt{6}$; $\norm{\overline{BC}} = \sqrt{17}$; $\norm{\overline{AC}} = \sqrt{11}$. Yes, it is a right triangle as $\norm{\overline{AB}}^2+\norm{\overline{AC}}^2=\norm{\overline{BC}}^2$.}

\exercise{The points $A=(1,1,3)$, $B=(3,2,7)$, $C=(2,0,8)$ and $D = (0,-1,4)$ form a quadrilateral $ABCD$ in space. Is this a parallelogram?}{Yes, as opposite sides have equal length. $\norm{\overline{AB}} = \sqrt{21}=\norm{\overline{CD}}$; $\norm{\overline{BC}} = \sqrt{6}=\norm{\overline{AD}}$.}
