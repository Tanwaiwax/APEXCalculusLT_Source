\exerciseset{In Exercises}{, describe the region in space defined by the inequalities.
}{

\exercise{$x^2+y^2+z^2<1$
}{Interior of a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin.
}

\exercise{$0\leq x\leq 3$
}{Region bounded between the planes $x=0$ (the $y-z$ coordinate plane) and $x=3$.
}

\exercise{$x\geq 0,\ y\geq0, \ z\geq0$
}{The first octant of space; all points $(x,y,z)$ where each of $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive. (Analogous to the first quadrant in the plane.)
}

\exercise{$y\geq 3$
}{All points in space where the $y$ value is greater than 3; viewing space as often depicted in this text, this is the region ``to the right'' of the plane $y=3$ (which is parallel to the $x-z$ coordinate plane.)
