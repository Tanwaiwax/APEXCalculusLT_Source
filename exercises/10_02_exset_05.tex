In Exercises}{,  angles $\theta$ and $\varphi$ are given. Find the force applied to each chain.}{

\exercise{$\theta = 30^\circ$,\quad $\varphi=30^\circ$}{The force on each chain is  $100/\sqrt{3}\approx 57.735$lb.}

\exercise{$\theta = 60^\circ$,\quad $\varphi=60^\circ$}{The force on each chain is  $100$lb.}

\exercise{$\theta = 20^\circ$,\quad $\varphi=15^\circ$}{The force on the chain with angle $\theta$ is approx. $45.124$lb; the force on the chain with angle $\varphi$ is approx. $59.629$lb.}

\exercise{$\theta = 0^\circ$,\quad $\varphi=0^\circ$}{The force on each chain is 50lb.}
