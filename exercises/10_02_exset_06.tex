\exerciseset{A weight of $p$lb is suspended from a chain of length $\ell$ while a constant force of $\vec F_w$ pushes the weight to the right, making an angle of $\theta$ with the vertical, as shown in the figure below.

In Exercises}{,  a force $\vec F_w$ and length $\ell$ are given. Find the angle $\theta$ and the height the weight is lifted as it moves to the right.
}{

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 1$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb
}{$\theta = 45^\circ$; the weight is lifted $0.29$ ft (about 3.5in).
}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 1$ft, \quad $p = 10$lb
}{$\theta = 5.71^\circ$; the weight is lifted $0.005$ ft (about 1/16th of an inch).
}

\exercise{$\vec F_w=1$lb, \quad $\ell = 10$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb
}{$\theta = 45^\circ$; the weight is lifted $2.93$ ft.

\exercise{$\vec F_w=10$lb, \quad $\ell = 10$ft, \quad $p = 1$lb
}{$\theta = 84.29^\circ$; the weight is lifted $9$ ft.
