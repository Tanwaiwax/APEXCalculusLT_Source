\exercise{The dot product of two vectors is a \underline{\hskip .5in}, not a vector.
}{Scalar
}

\exercise{How are the concepts of the dot product and vector magnitude related?
}{The magnitude of a vectors is the square root of the dot product of a vector with itself; that is, 
$\norm{\vec v} = \sqrt{\vec v\cdot \vec v}$.
}

\exercise{How can one quickly tell if the angle between two vectors is acute or obtuse?
}{By considering the sign of the dot product of the two vectors. If the dot product is positive, the angle is acute; if the dot product is negative, the angle is obtuse.
