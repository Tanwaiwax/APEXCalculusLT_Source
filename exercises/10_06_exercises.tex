\exercise{In order to find the equation of a plane, what two pieces of information must one have?}{A point in the plane and a normal vector (i.e., a direction orthogonal to the plane).}

\exercise{What is the relationship between a plane and one of its normal vectors?}{A normal vector is orthogonal to the plane.}

\exercise{Show why if the point $Q$ lies in a plane, then the distance formula correctly gives the distance from the point to the plane as $0$.}{If $P$ is any point in the plane, and $Q$ is also in the plane, then $\vv{PQ}$ lies parallel to the plane and is orthogonal to $\vec n$, the normal vector. Thus $\vec n\cdot \vv{PQ}=0$, giving the distance as 0.}

\exercise{How is Exercise \ref{int_lines_dist} in \autoref{sec:lines} easier to answer once we have an understanding of planes?}{The intersecting lines define a plane with normal vector $\vec n = \vec c = \vec d_1\times \vec d_2$. Since points $P_1$ and $P_2$ lie in the plane, $\vec c$ is orthogonal to $\vv{P_1P_2}$, hence $\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot\vec c = 0$, giving a distance of 0. Knowing the principles of planes, especially their normal vectors, makes this simpler.}
