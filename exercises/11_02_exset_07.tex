\exerciseset{Exercises}{ ask you to verify parts of \autoref{thm:vvf_deriv_prop}. In each let $f(t) = t^3$, $\vec r(t) =\la t^2,t-1,1\ra$ and $\vec s(t) = \la \sin t, e^t,t\ra$. Compute the various derivatives as indicated.
}{

\exercise{Simplify $f(t)\vec r(t)$, then find its derivative; show this is the same as $\fp(t)\vec r(t) + f(t)\vrp(t)$.
}{
Both derivatives return $\la 5t^4,4t^3-3t^2,3t^2\ra$.
}

\exercise{Simplify $\vec r(t)\cdot\vec s(t)$, then find its derivative; show this is the same as $\vrp(t)\cdot\vec s(t) + \vec r(t)\cdot\vec s\,'(t)$.
}{
Both derivatives return $2\sin t+t^2\cos t + te^t+1$.
}

\exercise{Simplify $\vec r(t)\times\vec s(t)$, then find its derivative; show this is the same as $\vrp(t)\times\vec s(t) + \vec r(t)\times\vec s\,'(t)$.
}{
Both derivatives return $\la 2t-e^t-1,\cos t-3t^2,(t^2+2t)e^t-(t-1)\cos t-\sin t\ra$.
