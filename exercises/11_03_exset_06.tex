\exercise{An object with position function $\vrt = \la 2\cos t,2\sin t, 3t\ra$, where distances are measured in feet and time is in seconds, on $[0,2\pi]$.
}{Displacement: $\la 0,0,6\pi\ra$; distance traveled: $2\sqrt{13}\pi \approx 22.65$ft; average velocity: $\la 0,0,3\ra$; average speed: $\sqrt{13} \approx 3.61$ft/s

\exercise{An object with position function $\vrt = \la 5\cos t,-5\sin t\ra$, where distances are measured in feet and time is in seconds, on $[0,\pi]$.
}{Displacement: $\la -10,0\ra$; distance traveled: $5\pi \approx 15.71$ft; average velocity: $\la -10/\pi,0\ra\approx \la -3.18,0\ra$; average speed: $5$ft/s
