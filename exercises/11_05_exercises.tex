\exercise{It is common to describe position in terms of both \underline{\hskip .5in} and/or \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{time and/or distance}

\exercise{A measure of the ``curviness'' of a curve is \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{curvature}

\exercise{Give two shapes with constant curvature.}{Answers may include lines, circles, helixes}

\exercise{Describe in your own words what an ``osculating circle'' is. }{Answers will vary; they should mention the circle is tangent to the curve and has the same curvature as the curve at that point.}

\exercise{Complete the identity: $\vec T\,'(s) = \underline{\hskip .5in}\vec N(s)$.}{$\kappa$}

\exercise{Given a position function \vrt, how are $a_{\text{T}}$ and $a_{\text{N}}$ affected by the curvature?}{$a_{\text{T}}$ is not affected by curvature; the greater the curvature, the larger $a_{\text{N}}$ becomes.}

\exercise{For \autoref{thm:curvature_formulas}, use part 3 to prove part 2: If $\vec r(t)=\bracket{x(t), y(t)}$ is a vector-valued function in the plane, then
\[\kappa = \frac{\abs{x\primeskip'y\primeskip''-x\primeskip''y\primeskip'}}{\big((x\primeskip')^2+(y\primeskip')^2\big)^{3/2}}.\]}{Let $\vec r(t)=\bracket{x(t),y(t),0}$ and apply the second formula of part 3.}

\exercise{For \autoref{thm:curvature_formulas}, use part 2 or 3 to prove part 1: If $y=f(x)$, then
\[\kappa = \frac{\abs{\fpp(x)}}{\big(1+(\fp(x))^2\big)^{3/2}}.\]}{Let $\vec r(t)=\bracket{t,f(t),0}$ and apply part 2 or the second formula of part 3.}
