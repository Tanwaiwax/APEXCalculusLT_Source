\exercise{$y=\tan x$, at $x=\pi/4$}{radius of curvature is $5\sqrt{5}/4$.}

\exercise{$y=x^2+x-3$, at $x=\pi/4$}{radius of curvature is $5\sqrt{10}$.}

\exercise{$\vrt =\bracket{\cos t, \sin (3t)}$, at $t=0$}{radius of curvature is $9$.}

\exercise{$\vrt =\bracket{5\cos (3 t), t}$, at $t=0$}{radius of curvature is $1/45$.}
