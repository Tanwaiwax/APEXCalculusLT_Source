\begin{exerciseset}{In Exercises}{, describe the level surfaces of the given functions of three variables.}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2$}{The level surfaces are spheres, centered at the origin, with radius $\sqrt{c}$.}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y,z) = z-x^2+y^2$}{The level surfaces are hyperbolic paraboloids of the form $z=x^2-y^2+c$; each is shifted up/down by $c$.}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y,z) = \frac{x^2+y^2}{z}$}{The level surfaces are paraboloids of the form $z=\frac{x^2}{c}+\frac{y^2}{c}$; the larger $c$, the ``wider'' the paraboloid.}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y,z) = \frac{z}{x-y}$}{The level surfaces are planes through the origin of the form $cx-cy-z=0$, that is, planes through the origin with normal vector $\bracket{c,-c,-1}$.}
