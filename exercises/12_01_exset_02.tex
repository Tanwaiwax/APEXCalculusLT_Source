\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = 3x-2y$; $c = -2,0,2$}{Level curves are lines $y = (3/2)x-c/2$.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = x^2-y^2$; $c = -1,0,1$}{Level curves are hyperbolas $\frac{x^2}{c}-\frac{y^2}{c}=1$, except for $c=0$, where the level curve is the pair of lines $y=x$, $y=-x$.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = x-y^2$; $c = -2,0,2$}{Level curves are parabolas $x=y^2+c$.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = \frac{1-x^2-y^2}{2y-2x}$; $c = -2,0,2$}{Level curves are hyperbolas $(x-c)^2-(y-c)^2=1$, drawn in graph in different styles to differentiate the curves.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = \frac{2x-2y}{x^2+y^2+1}$; $c = -1,0,1$}{Level curves are circles, centered at $(1/c,-1/c)$ with radius $\sqrt{2/c^2-1}$. When $c=0$, the level curve is the line $y=x$.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = \frac{y-x^3-1}{x}$; $c = -3,-1,0,1,3$}{Level curves are cubics of the form $y=x^3+cx+1$. Note how each curve passes through $(0,1)$ and that the function is not defined at $x=0$.\\

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2+4y^2}$; $c = 1,2,3,4$\label{12_01_ex_21}}{Level curves are ellipses of the form $\frac{x^2}{c^2}+\frac{y^2}{c^2/4}=1$, i.e., $a=c$ and $b=c/2$.\\
