\exercise{Describe in your own words the difference between boundary and interior points of a set.}{Answers will vary.}

\exercise{Use your own words to describe (informally) what $\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to (1,2)} f(x,y) = 17$ means.}{Answers will vary. One answer is ``As $(x,y)$ gets close to $(1,2)$, $f(x,y)$ gets close to 17.''}

\exercise{Give an example of a closed, bounded set.}{Answers will vary.\\
One possible answer: $\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2\leq 1\}$}

\exercise{Give an example of a closed, unbounded set.}{Answers will vary.\\
One possible answer: $\{(x,y) | y\geq x^2 \}$}

\exercise{Give an example of a open, bounded set.}{Answers will vary.\\
One possible answer: $\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2<1 \}$}

\exercise{Give an example of a open, unbounded set.}{Answers will vary.\\
One possible answer: $\{(x,y) | y> x^2 \}$}

\exercise{Use the Squeeze Theorem to show
\[\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\sin(xy)\cos\left(\frac1{x^2+y^2}\right)=0.\]}{Hint: Consider $-\abs{\sin(xy)}\leq\sin(xy)\cos\left(\frac1{x^2+y^2}\right)\leq\abs{\sin(xy)}$.}

\exercise{Let $f(x, y)=\dfrac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Show that $f(x,y)\to0$ along every line through the origin.
\item  Despite this, show that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist.
\end{enumerate}}{Hint: For the second part, consider the path $y=x^2$.}

\exercise{Show that 
\[\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^4-9y^4}{x^2+3y^2}=0.\]}{Hint: $x^4-9y^4=(x^2+3y^2)(x^2-3y^2)$.}
