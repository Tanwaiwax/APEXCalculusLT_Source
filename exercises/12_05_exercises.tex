\exercise{What is the difference between a directional derivative and a partial derivative?}{A partial derivative is essentially a special case of a directional derivative; it is the directional derivative in the direction of $x$ or $y$, i.e., $\la 1,0\ra$ or $\la 0,1\ra$.}

\exercise{For what $\vec u$ is $D_{\vec u\,} f = f_x$?}{$\vec u = \la 1,0\ra$}

\exercise{For what $\vec u$ is $D_{\vec u\,} f = f_y$?}{$\vec u = \la 0,1\ra$}

\exercise{The gradient is \underline{\hskip .5in} to level curves.}{orthogonal}

\exercise{The gradient points in the direction of \underline{\hskip .5in} increase.}{maximal, or greatest}

\exercise{It is generally more informative to view the directional derivative not as the result of a limit, but rather as the result of a \underline{\hskip .5in} product.}{dot}
