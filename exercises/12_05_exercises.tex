\exercise{What is the difference between a directional derivative and a partial derivative?}{A partial derivative is essentially a special case of a directional derivative; it is the directional derivative in the direction of $x$ or $y$, i.e., $\bracket{1,0}$ or $\bracket{0,1}$.}

\exercise{For what $\vec u$ is $D_{\vec u\,} f = f_x$?}{$\vec u =\bracket{1,0}$}

\exercise{For what $\vec u$ is $D_{\vec u\,} f = f_y$?}{$\vec u =\bracket{0,1}$}

\exercise{The gradient is \underline{\hskip .5in} to level curves.}{orthogonal}

\exercise{The gradient points in the direction of \underline{\hskip .5in} increase.}{maximal, or greatest}

\exercise{It is generally more informative to view the directional derivative not as the result of a limit, but rather as the result of a \underline{\hskip .5in} product.}{dot}

\printproblems

% todo Tim make the directions more consistent.  maybe combine sets and make more parts?
