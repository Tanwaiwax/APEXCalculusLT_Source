\exercise{T/F: \autoref{thm:multi_critical_point} states that if $f$ has a critical point at $P$, then $f$ has a relative extrema at $P$.}{F; it is the ``other way around.''}

\exercise{T/F: A point $P$ is a critical point of $f$ if $f_x$ and $f_y$ are both 0 at $P$.}{T}

\exercise{T/F: A point $P$ is a critical point of $f$ if $f_x$ or $f_y$ are undefined at $P$.}{T}

\exercise{Explain what it means to ``solve a constrained optimization'' problem.}{Answers will vary. A good answer will state that we are optimizing a function subject to a constraint, or limit, on the domain of the function. We are looking to maximize/minimize the function while ``looking'' at only a certain part of the domain.}
