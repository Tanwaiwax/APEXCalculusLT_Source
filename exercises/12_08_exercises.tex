\exercise{Let a level curve of $z=f(x,y)$ be described by $x=g(t)$, $y = h(t)$. Explain why $\frac{dz}{dt}=0$.}{Because the parametric equations describe a level curve, $z$ is constant for all $t$. Therefore $\frac{dz}{dt}=0$.}

\exercise{Fill in the blank: The single variable Chain Rule states $\ds\frac{d}{dx}\Big(f\big(g(x)\big)\Big) = \fp\big(g(x)\big)\cdot$\underline{\hskip.5in}.}{$g'(x)$}

\exercise{Fill in the blank: The Multivariable Chain Rule states \\[5pt]
$\ds\frac{df}{dt}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\cdot\text{\underline{\hskip.5in}}+\text{\underline{\hskip.5in}}\cdot\frac{dy}{dt}$.}{$\frac{dx}{dt}$, and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$}

\exercise{If $z=f(x,y)$, where $x=g(t)$ and $y=h(t)$, we can substitute and write $z$ as an explicit function of $t$.\\
T/F: Using the Multivariable Chain Rule to find $\frac{dz}{dt}$ is  sometimes easier than  first substituting and then taking the derivative.}{T}

\exercise{T/F: The  Multivariable Chain Rule is only useful when all the related functions are known explicitly.}{F}

\exercise{Suppose the radius of a circular cylinder is increasing at the constant rate of $1/2$ cm/sec while its height is decreasing at the rate of $1/3$ cm/sec.  How is the volume of the cylinder changing when the radius $4$ cm and the height is $10$ cm?}{It is increasing at $104\pi/3$ cm\textsuperscript3/sec}
