\exercise{Let a level curve of $z=f(x,y)$ be described by $x=g(t)$, $y = h(t)$. Explain why $\frac{dz}{dt}=0$.
}{Because the parametric equations describe a level curve, $z$ is constant for all $t$. Therefore $\frac{dz}{dt}=0$.

\exercise{If $z=f(x,y)$, where $x=g(t)$ and $y=h(t)$, we can substitute and write $z$ as an explicit function of $t$.\\
T/F: Using the Multivariable Chain Rule to find $\frac{dz}{dt}$ is  sometimes easier than  first substituting and then taking the derivative.
