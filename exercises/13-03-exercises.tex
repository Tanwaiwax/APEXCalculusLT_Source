\exercise{When evaluating $\ds\iint_R f(x,y)\dd A$ using polar coordinates, $f(x,y)$ is replaced with \underline{\hskip .5in} and $\dd A$ is replaced with \underline{\hskip.5in}.}{$f\big(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\big)$, $r\dd r\dd\theta$}

\exercise{Why would one be interested in evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates?}{Some regions in the $x$-$y$ plane are easier to describe using polar coordinates than using rectangular coordinates. Also, some integrals are easier to evaluate one the polar substitutions have been made.}
