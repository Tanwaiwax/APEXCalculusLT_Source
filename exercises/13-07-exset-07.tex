\exercisesetinstructions{, a solid is described along with its density function. Find the center of mass of the solid using cylindrical coordinates. (Note: these are the same solids and density functions as found in Exercises~\ref{ex:13_07_ex_23}--\ref{ex:13_07_ex_26}.)}

\exercise{Bounded by the cylinder $x^2+y^2=4$ and the planes $z=0$ and $z=4$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1$. }{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = r+1$. Thus mass is
\[M=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2\int_0^4 (r+1)r\dd z\dd r\dd \theta = 112\pi/3.\]

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = 224\pi/3$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,2)$.}

\exercise{Bounded by the cylinders $x^2+y^2=4$ and $x^2+y^2=9$, between the planes $z=0$ and $z=10$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =z$. }{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = z$. Thus mass is
\[M=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_2^3\int_0^{10} zr\dd z\dd r\dd \theta = 250\pi.\]

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = 5000\pi/3$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,20/3)$.}

\exercise{Bounded by $y\geq 0$, the cylinder $x^2+y^2=1$, and between the planes $z=0$ and $z=4-y$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$.}{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^\pi\int_0^1\int_0^{4-r\sin\theta}r\dd z\dd r\dd \theta=2\pi-2/3\approx 5.617.\]

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 8/3-\pi/8$, and $M_{xy} = 65\pi/16-8/3$, placing the center of mass at $\approx (0,0.405,1.80)$.}

\exercise{The upper half of the unit ball, bounded between $z= 0$ and $z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$, with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$.
%\label{ex:13_07_ex_26} 
}{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-r^2}}^{\sqrt{1-r^2}} r\dd z\dd r\dd \theta=2\pi/3.\]

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = \pi/4$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,3/8)$.}
