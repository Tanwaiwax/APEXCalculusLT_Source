\exercise{When integrating $f_x(x,y)$ with respect to $x$, the constant of integration $C$ is really which: $C(x)$ or $C(y)$? What does this mean?}{$C(y)$, meaning that instead of being just a constant, like the number 5, it is a function of $y$, which acts like a constant when taking derivatives with respect to $x$.}

\exercise{Integrating an integral is called \underline{\hskip .5in} \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{iterated integration}

\exercise{When evaluating an iterated integral, we integrate from \underline{\hskip .5in} to \underline{\hskip .5in}, then from \underline{\hskip .5in} to \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{curve to curve, then from point to point}

\exercise{One understanding of an iterated integral is that\\
$\ds \int_a^b\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \dd y\dd x$ gives the \underline{\hskip .5in} of a plane region.}{area}
