\exercise{Explain why the following statement is false:  ``Fubini's Theorem states that
\[\ds \int_a^b\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y)\dd y\dd x = \int_a^b\int_{g_1(y)}^{g_2(y)} f(x,y)\dd x\dd y.''\]}{When switching the order of integration, the bounds integrals must change to reflect the bounds of the region of integration. You cannot merely change the letters $x$ and $y$ in a few places.}

\exercise{Explain why if $f(x,y)>0$ over a region $R$, then\\
$\ds\iint_Rf(x,y)\dd A>0$.}{The double integral gives the signed volume under the surface. Since the surface is always positive, it is always above the $x$-$y$ plane and hence produces only ``positive'' volume.}

\exercise{If $\ds\iint_R f(x,y)\dd A = \iint_R g(x,y)\dd A$, does this imply $f(x,y) = g(x,y)$?}{No. It means that there is the same amount of signed volume under $f$ and $g$ over $R$, but the functions could be very different.}
