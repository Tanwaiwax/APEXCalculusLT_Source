\begin{exerciseset}{In Exercises}{, state why it is difficult/impossible to integrate the iterated integral in the given order of integration. Change the order of integration and evaluate the new iterated integral.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^4\int_{y/2}^2 e^{x^2}\ dx\ dy$}{Integrating $e^{x^2}$ with respect to $x$ is not possible in terms of elementary functions. $\ds  \int_0^2\int_0^{2x}e^{x^2}\ dy\ dx = e^4-1$.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}}\int_{x}^{\sqrt{\pi/2}} \cos\big(y^2\big)\ dy\ dx$}{Integrating $\cos(y^2)$ with respect to $y$ is not possible in terms of elementary functions. $\ds  \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi/2}}\int_0^{y}\cos(y^2)\ dx\ dy = \frac12$.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{1}\int_y^{1} \frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}\ dx\ dy$}{Integrating $\ds\int_y^{1}\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}\ dx$ gives $\tan^{-1}(1/y)-\pi/4$; integrating $\tan^{-1}(1/y)$ is hard.

$\ds\int_0^1\int_0^x\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2}\ dy \ dx = \ln 2$.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_{-1}^{1}\int_1^{2} \frac{x\tan^2y}{1+\ln y}\ dy\ dx$}{Integrating in the order shown is hard / impossible. By changing the order of integration, we have $\ds \int_{1}^{2}\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{x\tan^2y}{1+\ln y}\ dx\ dy = 0$, since the integrand is an odd function with respect to $x$. Thus the iterated integral evaluates to 0.}
