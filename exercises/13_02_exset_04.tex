\begin{exerciseset}{In Exercises}{, find the average value of $f$ over the region $R$. Notice how these functions and regions are related to the iterated integrals given in Exercises~\ref{13_02_ex_05}--\ref{13_02_ex_08}.}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) =\frac xy+3$;\quad $R$ is the rectangle with opposite corners $(-1,1)$ and $(1,2)$.}{average value of $f = 6/2 = 3$}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = \sin x\cos y$; \quad $R$ is bounded by $x=0$, $x=\pi$, $y=-\pi/2$ and $y=\pi/2$.}{average value of $f= 4/\pi^2$}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) = 3x^2-y+2$;\quad $R$ is bounded by the lines $y=0$, $y=2-x/2$ and $x=0$.}{average value of $f= \frac{112/3}{4} =28/3$}

\exercise{$\ds f(x,y) =x^2y-xy^2$; \quad $R$ is bounded by $y=x$, $y=1$ and $x=3$.}{average value of $f= \frac{76/15}{2} = \frac{38}{15} \approx 2.53$}
