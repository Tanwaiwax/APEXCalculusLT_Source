\exercise{Why is it easy to use ``mass'' and ``weight'' interchangeably, even though they are different measures?}{Because they are scalar multiples of each other.}

\exercise{Given a point $(x,y)$, the value of $x$ is a measure of distance from the \underline{\hskip.5in}-axis.}{$y$}

\exercise{We can think of $\iint_R\dd m$ as meaning ``sum up lots of \underline{\hskip.5in}''}{``little masses''}

\exercise{What is a ``discrete planar system?''}{A collection of individual masses in the plane. Each mass is a point mass, i.e., mass located at a point, not across a region.}

\exercise{Why does $M_x$ use $\ds\iint_R y\delta(x,y)\dd A$ instead of\\
$\ds\iint_R x\delta(x,y)\dd A$; that is, why do we use ``$y$'' and not ``$x$''?}{$M_x$ measures the moment about the $x$-axis, meaning we need to measure distance from the $x$-axis. Such measurements are measures in the $y$-direction.}

\exercise{Describe a situation where the center of mass of a lamina does not lie within the region of the lamina itself.}{If the lamina is an annulus, the center of mass will likely be in the middle, outside of the region. (See \autoref{ex_mass9}.)}
