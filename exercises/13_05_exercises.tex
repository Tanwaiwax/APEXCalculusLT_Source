\exercise{``Surface area'' is analogous to what previously studied concept?}{arc length}

\exercise{To approximate the area of a small portion of a surface, we computed the area of its \underline{\hskip .5in} plane.}{tangent}

\exercise{We interpret $\ds \iint_R\ dS$ as ``sum up lots of little \underline{\hskip .5in} \underline{\hskip .5in}.''}{surface areas}

\exercise{Why is it important to know how to set up a double integral to compute surface area, even if the resulting integral is hard to evaluate?}{Technology makes good approximations accessible, if not exact answers.}

\exercise{Why do $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)=f(x,y)+h$, for some real number $h$, have the same surface area over a region $R$? }{Intuitively, adding $h$ to $f$ only shifts $f$ up (i.e., parallel to the $z$-axis) and does not change its shape. Therefore it will not change the surface area over $R$. 

Analytically, $f_x = g_x$ and $f_y=g_y$; therefore, the surface area of each is computed with identical double integrals.}

\exercise{Let $z=f(x,y)$ and $z=g(x,y)=2f(x,y)$. Why is the surface area of $g$ over a region $R$ not twice the surface area of $f$ over $R$?}{Analytically, $g_x = 2f_x$ and $g_y=2f_y$. The double integral to compute the surface area of $f$ over $R$ is $\ds \iint_R \sqrt{1+f_x^2+f_y^2}\ dA$; the double integral to compute the surface area of $g$ over $R$ is $\ds \iint_R\sqrt{1+4f_x^2+4f_y^2}\ dA$, which is \textit{not} twice the double integral used to calculate the surface area of $f$.}
