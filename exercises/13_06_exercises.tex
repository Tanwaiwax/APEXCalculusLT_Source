\exercise{The strategy for establishing bounds for triple integrals is ``\underline{\hskip .5in} to \underline{\hskip .5in}, \underline{\hskip .5in} to \underline{\hskip .5in} and \underline{\hskip .5in} to \underline{\hskip .5in}.''}{surface to surface, curve to curve and point to point}

\exercise{Give an informal interpretation of what ``$\ds \iiint_D\ dV$'' means.}{One possible answer is ``sum up lots of little volumes over $D$.''}

\exercise{Give two uses of triple integration.}{Answers can vary. From this section we used triple integration to find the volume of a solid region, the mass of a solid, and the center of mass of a solid.}

\exercise{If an object has a constant density $\delta$ and a volume $V$, what is its mass?}{$\delta V$.}
