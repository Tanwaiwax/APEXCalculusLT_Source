\item	A cylindrical surface or tube, centered along the $z$-axis of radius 1, extending from the $x$-$y$ plane up to the plane $z=1$ (i.e., the tube has a length of 1).
\item	This is a region of space, being half of a tube with ``thick'' walls of inner radius 1 and outer radius 2, centered along the $z$-axis with a length of 1, where the half ``below'' the $x$-$z$ plane is removed. 
\item	This is upper half of the sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin (i.e., the upper hemisphere).
\item	This is a region of space, where the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin, is removed from the ball of radius 3, centered at the origin.

\item	A square portion of the $y$-$z$ plane with corners at $(0,1,0)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(0,2,1)$ and $(0,2,0)$.
\item	 This is a curve, a circle of radius 2, centered at $(0,0,5)$, lying parallel to the $x$-$y$ plane (i.e., in the plane $z=5$).
\item	This is a region of space, a half of a solid cone with rounded top, where the rounded top is a portion of the ball of radius 2 centered at the origin and the sides of the cone make an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis. The bounds on $\theta$ mean only the portion ``above'' the $x$-$z$ plane are retained.
\item	This is a curve, a circle of radius 1 centered at $(0,0,\sqrt 3)$, lying parallel to the $x$-$y$ plane.
