\exerciseset{In Exercises}{, a triple integral in spherical coordinates is given. Describe the region in space defined by the bounds of the integral.}{

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{1} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{Describes the portion of the unit ball that resides in the first octant.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_1^{1.1} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{Describes half of a spherical shell (i.e., $y\geq 0$) with inner radius of $1$ and outer radius of $1.1$ centered at the origin.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi/4}\int_0^{2} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{Bounded above the cone $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and below the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$: describes a shape that is somewhat ``diamond''-like; some think of it as looking like an ice cream cone (see \autoref{fig:spherical3}). It describes a cone, where the side makes an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis, topped by the portion of the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{\pi/6}^{\pi/4}\int_0^{2} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{It is the region is space bounded below by $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and above by the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$, with the portion above the cone $z=\sqrt3\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ removed: it describes a cone, where the side makes an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis, topped by the portion of the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin, with the inner cone with angle $\pi/6$ removed, along with corresponding portion of the ball of radius 2.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi/6}\int_0^{\sec \varphi} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{The region in space is bounded below by the cone $z=\sqrt{3}\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and above by the plane $z=1$: it describes a cone, with point at the origin, centered along the positive $z$-axis, with height of 1 and base radius  of $\tan(\pi/6) = 1/\sqrt{3}$.}

\exercise{$\ds \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi/6}\int_0^{a\sec \varphi} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\varphi\ d\theta$}{The region in space is bounded below by the cone $z=\sqrt{3}\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and above by the plane $z=a$: it describes a cone, with point at the origin, centered along the positive $z$-axis, with height of $a$ and base radius  of $a\tan(\pi/6)$.}
