\exerciseset{In Exercises}{, a solid is described along with its density function. Find the mass of the solid using cylindrical coordinates.}{

\exercise{Bounded by the cylinder $x^2+y^2=4$ and the planes $z=0$ and $z=4$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1$. \label{ex:13_07_ex_23}}{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = r+1$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2\int_0^4 (r+1)r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 112\pi/3.\]}

\exercise{Bounded by the cylinders $x^2+y^2=4$ and $x^2+y^2=9$, between the planes $z=0$ and $z=10$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =z$. }{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = z$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^{2\pi}\int_2^3\int_0^{10} zr\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 250\pi.\]}

\exercise{Bounded by $y\geq 0$, the cylinder $x^2+y^2=1$, and between the planes $z=0$ and $z=4-y$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$. }{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^\pi\int_0^1\int_0^{4-r\sin\theta}r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta=2\pi-2/3\approx 5.617.\]}

\exercise{The upper half of the unit ball, bounded between $z= 0$ and $z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$, with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$.\label{ex:13_07_ex_26}}{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
\[\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-r^2}}^{\sqrt{1-r^2}}r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta=4\pi/3.\]}
