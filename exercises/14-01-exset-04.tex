\exercisesetinstructions{, a parameterized curve $C$ is given that represents a thin wire with density $\delta$. Find the mass and center of mass of the thin wire.}

\exercise{$C$: $\vec r(t) =\bracket{\cos t,\sin t, t}$ for $0\leq t\leq 4\pi$; $\delta(x,y,z) = z$ g/cm.}{$M=8\sqrt{2}\pi^2$ g; center of mass is $(0,-1/(2\pi), 8\pi/3)$.}

\exercise{$C$: $\vec r(t) =\bracket{t-t^2,t^2-t^3,t^3-t^4}$ for $0\leq t\leq 1$; $\delta(x,y,z) = x+2y+2z$ g/cm. Use technology to approximate the value of each integral. }{$M\approx 0.237$ g; center of mass is approximately $(0.173, 0.099,0.065)$.}

% Mecmath question cut for parity (also need to find the center of mass)
%\exercise{$C$ is in the shape of the parabola $y=x^2$ for $1\le x\le4$; $\delta(x,y)=y/x$ g/cm.}{$M=(65^{3/2}-5^{3/2})/12$ g}
