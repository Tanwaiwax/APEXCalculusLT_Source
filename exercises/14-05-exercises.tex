\exercise{In your own words, describe what an orientable surface is.}{Answers will vary, though generally should meaningfully include terms like ``two sided''.}

\exercise{Give an example of a non-orientable surface.}{Many possible answers exist; the one given by the book is the Möbius band.}

%\exercise{Prove part of \autoref{thm:conservative_field_curl}: let $\vec F =\bracket{M,N,P}$ be a conservative vector field. Show that $\curl \vec F = 0$.}{Since $\vec F$ is conservative, it is the gradient of some potential function. That is, $\nabla f =\bracket{f_x,f_y,f_z} = \vec F =\bracket{M,N,P}$. In particular, $M = f_x$, $N = f_y$ and $P=f_z$.
%
%Note that $\curl \vec F =\bracket{P_y - N_z, M_z-P_x, N_x-M_y } =\bracket{f_{zy} - f_{yz}, f_{xz} - f_{zx}, f_{yx} - f_{xy}}$, which, by \autoref{thm:mixed_partial}, is $\bracket{0,0,0}$.}
