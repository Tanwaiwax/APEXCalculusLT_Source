\exercise{Give two quantities that can be represented by a vector field in the plane or in space.}{Answers will vary. Appropriate answers include velocities of moving particles (air, water, etc.); gravitational or electromagnetic forces.}

\exercise{In your own words, describe what it means for a vector field to have a negative divergence at a point.}{Specific answers will vary, though should relate to the idea that ``more of the vector field is moving into that point than out of that point.''}

\exercise{In your own words, describe what it means for a vector field to have a negative curl at a point.}{Specific answers will vary, though should relate to the idea that the vector field is spinning clockwise at that point.}

\exercise{The divergence of a vector field $\vec F$ at a particular point is 0. Does this mean that $\vec F$ is incompressible? Why/why not?}{No; to be incompressible, the divergence needs to be 0 everywhere, not just at one point.}
