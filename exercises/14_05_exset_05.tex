\begin{exerciseset}{In Exercises}{, set up the double integral that finds the surface area $S$ of the given surface \surfaceS, then use technology to approximate its value.}

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$ over the circular disk of radius 3 centered at the origin.}{$S =\int_0^3\int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{v^2+4v^4}\dd u\dd v= (37\sqrt{37}-1)\pi/6 \approx 117.319$.}

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$ over the triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$ and $(1,1)$.}{$S = \int_0^1\int_0^1\sqrt{v^2+4u^2v^2+4v^4}\dd u\dd v \approx 0.931$.}

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the plane $z=5x-y$ over the region enclosed by the parabola $y=1-x^2$ and the $x$-axis.}{$S =\int_{-1}^1\int_0^{1-v^2}\sqrt{27}\dd u\dd v=4\sqrt3 \approx 6.928$.}

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the hyperbolic paraboloid $z=x^2-y^2$ over the circular disk of radius 1 centered at the origin.}{$S =\int_0^1\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sqrt{v^2+4v^4}\dd u\dd v = (5\sqrt{5}-1)\pi/6 \approx 5.330$.}
