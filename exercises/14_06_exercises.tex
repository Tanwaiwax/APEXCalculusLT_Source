\exercise{In the plane, flux is a measurement of how much of the vector field passes across a \underline{\hskip .5in}; in space, flux is a measurement of how much of the vector field passes across a \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{curve; surface}

\exercise{When computing flux, what does it mean when the result is a negative number?}{Answers will vary; in general, it means that more of the vector field passes through the surface opposite the direction of the normal vector than in the same direction of the normal vector.}

\exercise{When $\surfaceS$ is a closed surface, we choose the normal vector so that it points to the \underline{\hskip .5in} of the surface.}{outside}

\exercise{If \surfaceS\ is a plane, and $\vec F$ is always parallel to \surfaceS, then the flux of $\vec F$ across \surfaceS\ will be \underline{\hskip .5in}.}{0}

%\exercise{Prove part of \autoref{thm:conservative_field_curl}: let $\vec F =\bracket{M,N,P}$ be a conservative vector field. Show that $\curl \vec F = 0$.}{Since $\vec F$ is conservative, it is the gradient of some potential function. That is, $\nabla f = \bracket{f_x,f_y,f_z}= \vec F =\bracket{M, N, P}$. In particular, $M = f_x$, $N = f_y$ and $P=f_z$.
%
%Note that $\curl \vec F =\bracket{P_y - N_z, M_z-P_x, N_x-M_y}=\bracket{f_{zy} - f_{yz}, f_{xz} - f_{zx}, f_{yx} - f_{xy}}$, which, by \autoref{thm:mixed_partial}, is $\bracket{0,0,0}$.}
