\exerciseset{In Exercises}{, a surface \surfaceS\ that represents a thin sheet of material with density $\delta$ is given. Find the mass of each thin sheet.}{

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the plane $f(x,y)=x+y$ on $-2\leq x\leq 2$, $-3\leq y\leq 3$, with $\delta(x,y,z) = z$.}{$240\sqrt{3}$}

\exercise{\surfaceS\ is the unit sphere, with $\delta(x,y,z) = x+y+z+10$.}{$40\pi$}
