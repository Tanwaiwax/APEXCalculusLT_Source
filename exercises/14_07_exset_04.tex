\exerciseset{In Exercises}{, a closed curve $C$ that is the boundary of a surface \surfaceS\ is given along with a vector field $\vec F$. Find the circulation of $\vec F$ around $C$ either through direct computation or through Stokes' Theorem.}{

\exercise{$C$ is the curve whose $x$- and $y$-values are determined by the three sides of a triangle with vertices at $(-1,0)$, $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, traversed in that order, and the $z$-values are determined by the function $z=xy$; $\vec F =\bracket{z-y^2,x,z}$.
