{The position of a object is described by $s(t)=t^4 - 4t^2$, $t \geq 0$, where $s$ is in feet and $t$ is in seconds. Find
\begin{enumerate}
\item the velocity and acceleration functions for the object,
\item the acceleration after 1.5 seconds, and
\item the time(s), in seconds, when the object is at rest.
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item $v(t) = 4t^3 - 8t$, $a(t)=12t^2 - 8$
\item $a(1.5) = 19~ \text{ft/s}^2$
\item $t=0$ sec and $t=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$ sec
