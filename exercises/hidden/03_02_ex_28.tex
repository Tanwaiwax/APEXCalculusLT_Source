{\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that $f$ is differentiable everywhere and has 2 roots.  Show that $\fp$ has at least one real root.
\item Suppose that $f$ is twice differentiable everywhere and has 3 roots.  Show that $\fpp$ has at least one real root.
\end{enumerate}}
{(a) is Rolle's Theorem.  For (b), applying Rolle's Theorem to roots 1 and 2 and roots 2 and 3 shows that $\fp$ has two roots, and we can then apply (a).}
