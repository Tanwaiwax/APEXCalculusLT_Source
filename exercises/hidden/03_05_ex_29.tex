{Given $x^2+y^2=1$, use implicit differentiation to find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ and $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$. Use this information to justify the sketch of the unit circle.
}
{$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = -x/y$, so the function is increasing in second and fourth quadrants, decreasing in the first and third quadrants.

$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -1/y^3$, which is positive when $y<0$ and is negative when $y>0$. Hence the function is concave down in the first and second quadrants and concave up in the third and fourth quadrants.
