{The material to make the sides of a box costs 2 \textcent/in$^2$.  Making the bottom costs 4 \textcent/in$^2$, while the top costs 1 \textcent/in$^2$.  What are the dimensions of the least expensive box with a square base and a volume of 10 in$^3$?
}
{A length of 2 in and height of 2.5 will give a cost of 52\textcent.}
