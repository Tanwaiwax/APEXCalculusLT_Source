{A box needs to have a surface area of 12 in$^2$ and be twice as long as it is wide.  What is the largest volume the box can have?
}
{A box that is 1 in wide, 2 in long and $4/3$ in high will have a volume of $8/3\text{ in}^3$.}

% S = 12 = 2(2W)(W)+2(2W)(H)+2(W)(H)
%   = 4W^2 + 4HW + 2WH
%   = 4W^2 + 6WH
% H = (12-4W^2)/6W
%   = 2/W - 2W/3
% V = (2W)(W)(H)
%   = 2W^2(2/W-2W/3)
%   = 4W - 4W^3/3
% V' = 4-4W^2
% W = 1
% L = 2
% H = 4/3
% V = 8/3
