Can I use an external font

I have the following asy file which I compile with the commands
asy conicalhelix.asy
asy -noprc conicalhelix.asy


I include it using the following tex file:



The resulting pdf is 495KB.

If I comment out the font commands from the asy file and repeat everything, I get a pdf at the end that is 208KB, but the figures use the default font.  Is there a way for the prc file to use the font that is already embedded in the pdf?  If I have a program to view the prc file outside of a pdf, is there a way to link to an external font file?

If the answer to either of those is no, is there a way to embed only the glyphs of the font that I use, instead of the entire alphabet?
