\includegraphics{dir/by-nc}
\end{document}

In Windows, `\includegraphics{directory/file}` leads to the xml `<graphics candidates="directory\file.png" graphic="directory/file"/>`,
% from lib/LaTeXML/Package/graphicx.sty.ltxml
which leads to the html `<img src="directory%5Cfile.png">`.
% from LaTeXML-misc-xhtml.xsl
%5C is the url encoding for \, but this means that the html doesn't display the image.

% maybe lib/LaTeXML/Post/Graphics.pm
