Tim chap2:
“Instead, we will simply state that when the function f(x,y) is given by a single formula and is defined at the point (a,b) (e.g. is not some indeterminate form like 0/0) then you can just substitute (x,y)=(a,b) into the formula for f(x,y) to find the limit.” p.67 para.3
2.6 presents Newton’s method in 2 d (but no proof or explanation)
2.7 uses Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization, no “evaluate on the boundary”
Chain rule not until 4.2 p.147 for z(x(t),y(t)) and 4.5 p.166 for z(x(u,v),y(u,v)).

no Riemann sums for double integrals
evaluates limits at infinity
not as rigorous

Doojin chap4
pretty standard, slightly short on exercises
