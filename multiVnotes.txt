Here are my notes on 13.1-14.3.  Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve written.  "para" means paragraph, "L" means line.  Negative numbers indicate counting from the end.

Do we want to remove degrees when they come after the equivalent radian measure?

11:
p637 para1 L3 magnitude and direction -aspects-.
p637 para1 L-2 force -was- _is_ applied

11.1:
p637 Desperately needs a picture of a hand for the right hand rule.  Do we want to also talk about the version with your fingers curling from x to y to make your thumb point along z?
p638 fig 11.2: do we want the rest of the box edges, like in fig 11.1?
p641 L6: “an entirely different reason”. I doubt this.
p648 hyperboloid of two sheets: Should we end with “when |d|<|c|, there is no trace in the plane z=d”?

11.4
p680 Def 63: reverse the second coord?
p681 para3: Do we want to say “determinant”?
p684 para3 L1: remove “wonderful”
p685 para-2: Change to “This application is more commonly used to find the area of a triangle (because triangles are used more often than parallelograms).”
p688 Example 7: Remove the approximations.

11.5
p692 para-1 L-2: Just lie and use ’t’ instead of ‘x’.
p695 Why not just rescale d1 to be d2?

11.6
p701 Def 65: Should we include the “vector form” $<x-x_0,y-y_0,z-z_0>\cdot\nvec=0$ ?

12.1
What about 10.2&3: “(Calculus and) Parametric Equations”?  Some of this is very similar.
p717 Example 6: Mention that [-1,5] goes through the stopping point and then cycles again.

12.2
p726 Theorem 94: Note that order is important for part 5 (cross product).
p729 “A similar statement holds for R3.”  Do we want to just be saying this the whole time, instead of starting now?  We usually seem to have a separate statement.

12.3
p739 Do we want Key Idea 57 to no longer be a key idea?
p740 Example 5: Explain the negative t solution?

12.4
p747 I don’t like asking if T’ is the “right” perpendicular vector to T without saying what would make any answer right or wrong.
p749 Example 4 Should we rescale T’ before finding its norm?

12.5
p759 Theorem 102: part 3 should come first, and we present the proof.  The proofs of 1 and 2 should be exercises.
p761 Fig 12.32 caption needs to explain what (a) and (b) are.


13.1
p767 para 3 L1: “important” seems to not agree with “best”.  I agree it’s best, but if I have a reason to space them not evenly, I don’t think that means I’m breaking an important rule.
p769 para 4: Do we want to say why we don’t look at functions of 4 or more variables?  Perhaps at the top of p770?
p770 Change “A small amount of algebra” to “Taking reciprocals”

13.2
p772 Do we need Definition 81?  It seems like we mainly use open disks and sets, although closed does show up with finding extremal points.
p775 Theorems 3 & 4 dealt with $\lim_{x\to c}$.  Do we need to say that those theorems hold for $\vec x\to\vec c$?
p776 para 3 L3: “we can approach that point along a path that is not a straight line” should be “we can approach that point along any possible path”.
p778 para-1: In brief, I would say continuity is “a function equals its limit”.  No jumps is a nice way to think about it, not a brief definition.

13.3
p794 para-1 L1: Change “A brief review of this section:” to “We have seen that”

13.4
p798 para-2: This should be in an “Example”.  It’s also hard to follow.  The previous line was “it’s possible for a function to be differentiable but f_x and/or f_y not be continuous”.  Then we launch into an example where f_x and f_y aren’t continuous, and conclude that this function is neither differentiable nor continuous.  But finding a function that isn’t continuous isn’t really that impressive.  So why is it here?  I’d rather have something where f_x and/or f_y aren’t continuous, but f is still differentiable, if such an example would be at the appropriate level.

13.5
p806 Example 2: This feels really artificial.  Could we find an actual example where it’s more natural not to know the underlying functions?
p807 Example 3: All that arguing about how we shouldn’t just plug in and find the function of t, and we give an example where it simplifies to z=1-.5sin2t.  We should find a better example.
p808 Theorem 111: We need to follow this up with a figure that clarifies what’s going on. (E.g., Stewart p950-952)
p810 Example 6 para 1: Example 2.4.6 took a full page because we stepped through all the details.  Here, we go through the derivations much faster, so the comparison is misleading.

13.6
p814 I’d like to introduce the idea of $\nabla$ being an operator here, instead of waiting until 15.6.  Do we want a vector arrow over nabla?
p815 para-2 L2: “meaning the gradient is orthogonal to r itself.”  I think he means “meaning the gradient is orthogonal to the level curve.”

13.7
p825 Definition 96: Do we what to remove a and b?
p829 Definition 98 and 94 (13.6p818) both define $\nabla F$ for $F:R^3\to R$.  Do we want to remove one of them?

13.8
p832 Definition 100 L-1: change ‘and/or’ to ‘or’
p838 Example 6: I’d like to postpone evaluating f until after we’ve found all of the critical points.

13.9
The ‘maximize/given’ formulation is from the other book.  It’d be good to reformat to match the rest of this chapter.
p843 para3 L-3: “bounded” was defined in 13.2.  Do we want to refer back to it?  Or unbold it?
p844 Example 3: If I were solving this, I would change it to f=80-2x+1-4y+4=-2x-4y+85, which somewhat simplifies things.  Introducing that would really confuse things.  Do we want a different problem to look at?

14.1
p850 para3: I would rather say “When integrating by x, the bounds do not depend on x, and the result is no longer a function of x.  When integrating by y, the bounds do not depend on y, and the result is no longer a function of y.”
p852 para1: “It is useful to remember…”  I don’t find this useful.  I think it would be better to say “After integrating with respect to a variable, that variable is no longer present.”
p854 Example 5 para-1: Smaller horizontal spacing on the displayed equation.
Do we want to say that changing the order of integration is justified in the next section by Fubini’s Theorem?

14.2
p861 I still don’t like “curve to curve, point to point”.  On the other hand, “surface to surface, curve to curve, point to point” is a nice way to look at it in 3 dimensions.

14.3
p875 Example 5: We should delete the last sentence “Should the artist want to scale the piece uniformly, …”


14.4
Should we use g for gram instead of gm?
The text uses units for the mass / weight, but not for the moments nor center of mass.

14.6
p904 L6: we’ve been using u^3 before, not units^3.
p905 Theorem 130: Should we point out these are the versions of Theorem 124 (14.2p864) that apply when f=1?
p914 para-1: Closing the chapter

14.7
p923 Key Idea 62: duplicates 14.3 Key Idea 61 (p871).  Do we just want to say “verifies”?  And cut examples 2 & 3?

15.1
p934 para1 L-3: differential of F was introduced as total differential in 13.4 Definition 88 (p796).  Put a note back to that.

15.2
p943 Theorem 137 is introduced as a corollary, which makes it the only one in the book.  Do we want other corollaries, with a different color box than theorems?  Or just not use the word corollary?

15.6
How key are key ideas 65-67 (div grad curl Laplacian in various coordinate systems)?  Do we want people trying to memorize that?


Do we want a postscript showing the various fundamental theorems and how they’re all related?
