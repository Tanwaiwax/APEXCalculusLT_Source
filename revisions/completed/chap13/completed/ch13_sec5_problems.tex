\begin{enumerate}
\item  Suppose $z = f(x, y)$ is differentiable.  Express $(x, y)$ in polar coordinates as $x = r \cos \theta$, $y = r \sin \theta$.  Calculate $\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial \theta}$.

[Sol. $z_{\theta} = f_x(x,y) (-r \sin \theta) + f_y(x,y) (r \cos \theta)$] \\


\item  Suppose $w = g(x, y, z)$ is differentiable.  Express $(x, y, z)$ in spherical coordinates as $x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta$, $y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta$, $z = \rho \cos \phi$.  Calculate $\dfrac{\partial w}{\partial \phi}$.


[Sol. $w_{\phi} = f_x(x,y,z)(\rho \cos \phi \cos \theta)  + f_y(x,y,z)(\rho \cos \phi \sin \theta) + f_z(x,y,z)(-\rho \sin \phi)$] \\


\item  Suppose the radius of a circular cylinder is increasing at the constant rate of $1/2$ cm/sec while its height is decreasing at the rate of $1/3$ cm/sec.  How is the volume of the cylinder changing when the radius $4$ cm and the height is $10$ cm?

[Sol. Volume is increasing at $104 \pi/3 \  \text{cm}^3/\text{sec}$]  \\
