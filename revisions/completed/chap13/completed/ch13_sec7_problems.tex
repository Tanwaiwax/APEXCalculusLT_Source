\emph{Strike everything after the displayed ``$4x^3 + x - 2 = 0.$'' and continue as follows.}

Now we consider the cubic polynomial $g(x) = 4x^3 + x - 2$.  We have $g(0) = -2 < 0$ and $g(1) = 3 > 0$ so there is at least one real root by the Intermediate Value Theorem.  Since $g'(x) = 12x^2 + 1 > 0$ there is at most one real root.  Call this unique real root $r$.  Then $P = (r, r, 2 - 2r^2)$ and so the distance from $Q$ to the surface is
\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{PQ} \right\| = \sqrt{(2-r)^2 + (2-r)^2 + (2r^2)^2}
\]
What is $r$?  In general it is difficult (or impossible) to find the roots of a polynomial explicitly.  In this case we could use the cubic formula (if we happen to know it) to find
\[
r = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt[3]{ 2 + \sqrt{\frac{109}{27}} } + \sqrt[3]{ 2 - \sqrt{\frac{109}{27}} } \right)
\]
but this isn't an especially useful representation for $r$.  
We can approximate $r$ with a numerical technique (like the Bisection or Newton's Method) or by using whatever algorithm is built into your calculator or favorite computer program.  We find $r \approx .689$.  Thus
\[
P \approx (0.689, 0.689, 1.051) \text{ and } \left\| \overrightarrow{PQ} \right\| \approx 2.083.
\]
