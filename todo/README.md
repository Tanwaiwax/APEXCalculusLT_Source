TODO LIST
===================

This is an overview of the todo lists for this text.

The most critical (and perpetual) todo is that the text needs more problems and examples, and more difficult or interesting problems.  If you have a problem that you'd like to contribute, please email it to Tim (if you don't know Tim, use the gmail account with this username).  If you also include your problem's solution, that would be best, but not necessary.

If you want to roll up your sleeves and look for other things to do, those are generally included in the following files:
* [Calculus I](todo_calc1.txt)
* [Calculus II](todo_calc2.txt)
* [Calculus III](todo_calc3.txt)
* [notes to myself](todo_tim.txt)
* [TeX commands](todo_tex.txt) that might not be necessary if we did things correctly

If tackle one of these, let me know which file you're looking at, as well as what your contribution is.
