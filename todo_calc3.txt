./exercises/13_02_exercises.tex:% todo add exercises with Riemann sums
./headers/APEX_format.tex:\RequirePackage{amssymb} % todo ? https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/3000/107497 recommends dropping amssymb in favor of unicode-math
./text/10_Planes.tex:% todo should we make a picture of a vector ``orthogonal to the plane''?
